The capital and largest city in Norway is [Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo "Oslo").

Norway has a total area of 385,207 square kilometres (148,729 sq mi).[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-kart_2019-17) The country shares a long eastern border with [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden"), and is bordered by [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland "Finland") and [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia") to the northeast.

The unified kingdom of Norway was established in 872 as a merger of [petty kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_kingdoms_of_Norway "Petty kingdoms of Norway") and has existed continuously for 1,152–1,153 years.

Etymology
---------

[![Image 199](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Ohthere.jpg/330px-Ohthere.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ohthere.jpg)

Opening of [Ohthere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohthere_of_H%C3%A5logaland "Ohthere of Hålogaland")'s [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") account, translated: "Ohthere told his lord _Ælfrede_ king that he lived northmost of all Norwegians…"

Norway has two official names: _Norge_ in [Bokmål](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokm%C3%A5l "Bokmål") and _Noreg_ in [Nynorsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nynorsk "Nynorsk"). The English name Norway comes from the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") word _Norþweg_ mentioned in 880, meaning "northern way" or "way leading to the north", which is how the [Anglo-Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons "Anglo-Saxons") referred to the coastline of Atlantic Norway.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Nomino-NRK-34)[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Tvil-Forskning-35)[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-:2-36) The Anglo-Saxons of Britain also referred to the kingdom of Norway in 880 as _Norðmanna land_.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Nomino-NRK-34)[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Tvil-Forskning-35)

There is some disagreement about whether the native name of Norway originally had the same etymology as the English form. According to the traditional dominant view, the first component was originally [_norðr_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nor%C3%B0r "wikt:norðr"), a [cognate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate "Cognate") of English _north_, so the full name was _Norðr [vegr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vegr "wikt:vegr")_, "the way northwards", referring to the sailing route along the Norwegian coast, and contrasting with _suðrvegar_ "southern way" (from [Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse "Old Norse") [suðr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/su%C3%B0r "wikt:suðr")) for (Germany), and _austrvegr_ "eastern way" (from [austr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/austr "wikt:austr")) for the [Baltic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea "Baltic Sea").[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Heide_2016_p.-37)

History
-------

### Prehistory

The earliest traces of human occupation in Norway are found along the coast, where the huge ice shelf of the [last ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period "Last glacial period") first melted between 11,000 and 8000 BC. The oldest finds are stone tools dating from 9500 to 6000 BC, discovered in [Finnmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnmark "Finnmark") ([Komsa culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komsa_culture "Komsa culture")) in the north and [Rogaland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogaland "Rogaland") ([Fosna culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fosna-Hensbacka_culture "Fosna-Hensbacka culture")) in the southwest. Theories about the two cultures being separate were deemed obsolete in the 1970s.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Randsborg2009-38)

Between 3000 and 2500 BC, new settlers ([Corded Ware culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corded_Ware_culture "Corded Ware culture")) arrived in [eastern Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Norway "Eastern Norway"). They were [Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Europeans "Proto-Indo-Europeans") farmers who grew grain and kept livestock, and gradually replaced the hunting-fishing population of the west coast.

### Metal Ages

[![Image 200](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Bronze_Age_boats.png/220px-Bronze_Age_boats.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bronze_Age_boats.png)

[Nordic Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Bronze_Age "Nordic Bronze Age") [rock carvings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_carvings "Rock carvings") at [Steinkjer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinkjer "Steinkjer"), [Central Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Norway "Central Norway")

From about 1500 BC, [bronze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze "Bronze") was gradually introduced. Burial cairns built close to the sea as far north as [Harstad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harstad "Harstad") and also inland in the south are characteristic of this period, with rock carving motifs that differ from those of the [Stone Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age "Stone Age"), depicting ships resembling the [Hjortspring boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjortspring_boat "Hjortspring boat"), while large stone burial monuments known as [stone ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_ship "Stone ship") were also erected.[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-39)

There is little archaeological evidence dating to the early [Iron Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age "Iron Age") (the last 500 years BC). The dead were cremated, and their graves contained few goods. During the first four centuries AD, the people of Norway were in contact with Roman-occupied [Gaul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul "Gaul"); about 70 Roman bronze cauldrons, often used as burial urns, have been found. Contact with countries farther south brought a knowledge of [runes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runes "Runes"); the oldest known Norwegian runic inscription dates from the third century.

### Viking Age

[![Image 201](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Le_bateau_viking_dOseberg_%284835828216%29.jpg/137px-Le_bateau_viking_dOseberg_%284835828216%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Le_bateau_viking_dOseberg_(4835828216).jpg)

[![Image 202](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Viking_swords_at_Bergen_Museum.jpg/127px-Viking_swords_at_Bergen_Museum.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Viking_swords_at_Bergen_Museum.jpg)

By the time of the first historical records of Scandinavia, about the 8th century, several small political entities existed in Norway. It has been estimated that there were nine petty realms in Western Norway during the early [Viking Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age").[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-40) Archaeologist Bergljot Solberg on this basis estimates that there would have been at least 20 in the whole country.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-41)

In the Viking period, Norwegian Viking explorers discovered [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland "Iceland") by accident in the ninth century when heading for the [Faroe Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroe_Islands "Faroe Islands"), and eventually came across [Vinland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinland "Vinland"), known today as [Newfoundland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_(island) "Newfoundland (island)"), in Canada. The Vikings from Norway were most active in the northern and western [British Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles "British Isles") and eastern [North America isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_colonization_of_North_America "Norse colonization of North America").[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-42)

[![Image 203](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Gjermundbu_helmet_-_cropped.jpg/140px-Gjermundbu_helmet_-_cropped.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gjermundbu_helmet_-_cropped.jpg)

The [Gjermundbu helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjermundbu_helmet "Gjermundbu helmet") found in [Buskerud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buskerud "Buskerud") is the only known reconstructable [Viking Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age") helmet.

According to tradition, [Harald Fairhair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Fairhair "Harald Fairhair") unified them into one in 872 after the [Battle of Hafrsfjord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hafrsfjord "Battle of Hafrsfjord") in [Stavanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavanger "Stavanger"), thus becoming the first king of a united Norway.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-43) Harald's realm was mainly a South Norwegian coastal state. Fairhair ruled with a strong hand and according to the sagas, many Norwegians left the country to live in Iceland, the [Faroe Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroe_Islands "Faroe Islands"), [Greenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland "Greenland"), and parts of [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain "Great Britain") and Ireland.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-44)

[Haakon I the Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon_I_of_Norway "Haakon I of Norway") was Norway's first Christian king, in the mid-10th century, though his attempt to introduce the religion was rejected. [Norse traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology "Norse mythology") were replaced slowly by [Christian ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mythology "Christian mythology") in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. This is largely attributed to the missionary kings [Olaf I Tryggvasson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_I_of_Norway "Olaf I of Norway") and [Olaf II Haraldsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_II_of_Norway "Olaf II of Norway") (St. Olaf). Olaf Tryggvasson conducted raids in England, including attacking London. Arriving back in Norway in 995, Olaf landed in [Moster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moster_(island) "Moster (island)") where he built a church which became the first [Christian church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Moster_Church "Old Moster Church") in Norway. From Moster, Olaf sailed north to [Trondheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim_(city) "Trondheim (city)") where he was proclaimed King of Norway by the Eyrathing in 995.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-45) One of the most important sources for the history of the 11th century Vikings is the treaty between the Icelanders and Olaf II Haraldsson, king of Norway circa 1015 to 1028.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-46)

[Feudalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism "Feudalism") never really developed in Norway or Sweden, as it did in the rest of Europe. However, the administration of government took on a very conservative feudal character. The [Hanseatic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League "Hanseatic League") forced royalty to cede to them greater and greater concessions over foreign trade and the economy, because of the loans the Hansa had made to the royals and the large debt the kings were carrying. The League's monopolistic control over the economy of Norway put pressure on all classes, especially the peasantry, to the degree that no real [burgher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgher_(title) "Burgher (title)") class existed in Norway.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-47)

### High Middle Ages

[![Image 204](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Norwegian_Hereditary_Empire_excluding_Greenland.png/220px-Norwegian_Hereditary_Empire_excluding_Greenland.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Norwegian_Hereditary_Empire_excluding_Greenland.png)

[The Norwegian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Norway_(872%E2%80%931397) "Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)") at its greatest extent during the 13th century, including the [Open Border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway%E2%80%93Russia_border#History "Norway–Russia border") with the Novgorod Republic

From the 1040s to 1130, the country was at peace.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-48) In 1130, the [civil war era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war_era_in_Norway "Civil war era in Norway") broke out on the basis of [unclear succession laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_succession_to_the_Norwegian_throne "Line of succession to the Norwegian throne"), which allowed the king's sons to rule jointly. The [Archdiocese of Nidaros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdiocese_of_Nidaros "Archdiocese of Nidaros") was created in 1152 and attempted to control the appointment of kings.[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-49) The church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts. The wars ended in 1217 with the appointment of [Håkon IV Håkonsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_IV "Håkon IV"), who introduced clear laws of succession.[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-50)

From 1000 to 1300, the population increased from 150,000 to 400,000, resulting both in more land being cleared and the subdivision of farms. While in the Viking Age farmers owned their own land, by 1300, seventy per cent of the land was owned by the king, the church, or the aristocracy, and about twenty per cent of yields went to these landowners.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-51)

The 14th century is described as Norway's [golden age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_(metaphor) "Golden age (metaphor)"), with peace and increase in trade, especially with the British Islands, although Germany became increasingly important towards the end of the century. Throughout the [High Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Middle_Ages "High Middle Ages"), the king established Norway as a sovereign state with a central administration and local representatives.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-52)

In 1349, the [Black Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death "Black Death") spread to Norway and within a year killed a third of the population. Later plagues reduced the population to half the starting point by 1400. Many communities were entirely wiped out, resulting in an abundance of land, allowing farmers to switch to more [animal husbandry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_husbandry "Animal husbandry"). The reduction in taxes weakened the king's position,[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-53) and many aristocrats lost the basis for their surplus. High [tithes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe "Tithe") to church made it increasingly powerful and the archbishop became a member of the [Council of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Council_of_State "Norwegian Council of State").[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-s45-54)

[![Image 205](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Barrio_de_Bryggen%2C_Bergen.jpg/220px-Barrio_de_Bryggen%2C_Bergen.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Barrio_de_Bryggen,_Bergen.jpg)

[Bryggen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryggen "Bryggen") in [Bergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen_(city) "Bergen (city)"), once the centre of trade in Norway under the [Hanseatic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League "Hanseatic League") trade network, now preserved as a [World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site "World Heritage Site")

The [Hanseatic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League "Hanseatic League") took control over Norwegian trade during the 14th century and established a trading centre in [Bergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen_(city) "Bergen (city)"). In 1380, [Olaf Haakonsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_II_of_Denmark "Olaf II of Denmark") inherited both the Norwegian (as Olaf IV) and Danish thrones (as Olaf II), creating a union between the two countries.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-s45-54) In 1397, under [Margaret I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_I_of_Denmark "Margaret I of Denmark"), the [Kalmar Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar_Union "Kalmar Union") was created between the three Scandinavian countries. She waged war against the Germans, resulting in a trade blockade and higher taxation on Norwegian goods, which led to [a rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engelbrekt_rebellion "Engelbrekt rebellion"). However, the Norwegian Council of State was too weak to pull out of the union.[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-s46-55)

Margaret pursued a centralising policy which inevitably favoured Denmark because of its greater population.[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-56) Margaret also granted trade privileges to the Hanseatic merchants of [Lübeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCbeck "Lübeck") in Bergen in return for recognition of her rule, and these hurt the Norwegian economy. The Hanseatic merchants formed a state within a state in Bergen for generations.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-57) The "[Victual Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victual_Brothers "Victual Brothers")" launched three devastating pirate raids on the port (the last in 1427).[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-58)

Norway slipped ever more to the background under the [Oldenburg dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Oldenburg "House of Oldenburg") (established 1448). There was one revolt under [Knut Alvsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knut_Alvsson "Knut Alvsson") in 1502.[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-59) Norway took no part in the events which led to Swedish independence from Denmark in the 1520s.[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-60)

#### Kalmar Union

Upon the death of King [Haakon V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon_V_of_Norway "Haakon V of Norway") in 1319, [Magnus Eriksson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Eriksson "Magnus Eriksson"), at just three years old, inherited the throne as King Magnus VII. A simultaneous movement to make Magnus King of Sweden proved successful (he was a grandson of King [Magnus Ladulås](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_III_of_Sweden "Magnus III of Sweden") of Sweden), and both the kings of Sweden and of Denmark were elected to the throne by their respective nobles. Thus Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus VII.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-larsen-61)

In 1349, the [Black Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death "Black Death") killed between 50% and 60% of Norway's population[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-62) and led to a period of social and economic decline.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-enc-63) Although the death rate was comparable with the rest of Europe, economic recovery took much longer because of the small, scattered population.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-enc-63) Even before the plague, the population was only about 500,000.[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-end-64) After the plague, many farms lay idle while the population slowly increased.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-enc-63) However, the few surviving farms' tenants found their bargaining positions with their landlords greatly strengthened.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-enc-63)

[![Image 206](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Union_of_Kalmar_%281500%29.svg/220px-Union_of_Kalmar_%281500%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Union_of_Kalmar_(1500).svg)

The [Kalmar Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar_Union "Kalmar Union"), c. 1500

King Magnus VII ruled Norway until 1350, when his son, Haakon, was placed on the throne as [Haakon VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon_VI_of_Norway "Haakon VI of Norway").[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-autogenerated3-65) In 1363, Haakon married [Margaret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_I_of_Denmark "Margaret I of Denmark"), daughter of King [Valdemar IV of Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdemar_IV_of_Denmark "Valdemar IV of Denmark").[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-enc-63) Upon the death of Haakon in 1379, his 10-year-old son [Olaf IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_II_of_Denmark "Olaf II of Denmark") acceded to the throne.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-enc-63) As Olaf had already been elected to the throne of Denmark in 1376,[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-enc-63) Denmark and Norway entered a [personal union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_union "Personal union").[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-autogenerated2-66) Olaf's mother and Haakon's widow, Queen Margaret, managed the foreign affairs of Denmark and Norway during Olaf's minority.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-enc-63)

Margaret was on the verge of achieving a union of Sweden with Denmark and Norway when Olaf IV suddenly died.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-enc-63) Denmark made Margaret temporary ruler on the death of Olaf. On 2 February 1388, Norway followed suit and crowned Margaret.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-enc-63) Queen Margaret knew that her power would be more secure if she were able to find a king to rule in her place. She settled on [Eric of Pomerania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_of_Pomerania "Eric of Pomerania"), grandson of her sister. Thus at an all-Scandinavian meeting held at Kalmar, Erik of Pomerania was crowned king of all three Scandinavian countries, bringing the thrones of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden under the control of Queen Margaret when the country entered into the [Kalmar Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar_Union "Kalmar Union").

### Early modern period

After Sweden broke out of the [Kalmar Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar_Union "Kalmar Union") in 1521, Norway tried to follow suit,\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] but the subsequent rebellion was defeated, and Norway remained in a union with Denmark until 1814. This period was [by some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolai_Wergeland "Nicolai Wergeland") referred to as the "400-Year Night", since all of the kingdom's intellectual and administrative power was centred in [Copenhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen "Copenhagen").

[![Image 207](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Eerste_fase_van_de_Zeeslag_in_de_Sont_-_First_phase_of_the_Battle_of_the_Sound_-_November_8_1658_%28Jan_Abrahamsz_Beerstraten%2C_1660%29.jpg/220px-Eerste_fase_van_de_Zeeslag_in_de_Sont_-_First_phase_of_the_Battle_of_the_Sound_-_November_8_1658_%28Jan_Abrahamsz_Beerstraten%2C_1660%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eerste_fase_van_de_Zeeslag_in_de_Sont_-_First_phase_of_the_Battle_of_the_Sound_-_November_8_1658_(Jan_Abrahamsz_Beerstraten,_1660).jpg)

The [Battle of the Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Sound "Battle of the Sound") between an allied Dano-Norwegian–[Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic "Dutch Republic") fleet and the Swedish navy, 8 November 1658 (29 October [OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style "Old Style"))

With the [introduction of Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation_in_Denmark%E2%80%93Norway_and_Holstein "Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein") in 1536, the archbishopric in Trondheim was dissolved; Norway lost its independence and effectually became a colony of Denmark. The Church's income and possessions were instead redirected to the court in Copenhagen. Norway lost the steady stream of pilgrims to the relics of [St. Olav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_II_of_Norway "Olaf II of Norway") at the [Nidaros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidaros "Nidaros") shrine and, with them, much of the contact with cultural and economic life in the rest of Europe.

Eventually restored as a kingdom (albeit in legislative union with Denmark) in 1661, Norway saw its land area decrease in the 17th century with the loss of the provinces [Båhuslen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohusl%C3%A4n "Bohuslän"), [Jemtland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A4mtland "Jämtland"), and [Herjedalen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A4rjedalen "Härjedalen") to Sweden, as the result of a number of disastrous wars. In the north, its territory was increased by the acquisition of the provinces of [Troms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troms "Troms") and [Finnmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnmark "Finnmark"), at the expense of Sweden and Russia.

The [famine of 1695–1696](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1695%E2%80%931697 "Great Famine of 1695–1697") killed roughly 10% of Norway's population.[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-67) The harvest failed in Scandinavia at least nine times between 1740 and 1800, with great loss of life.[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-68)

### Later modern period

[![Image 208](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Eidsvoll_riksraad_1814.jpeg/220px-Eidsvoll_riksraad_1814.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eidsvoll_riksraad_1814.jpeg)

The 1814 constitutional assembly, painted by [Oscar Wergeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wergeland "Oscar Wergeland")

After Denmark–Norway was attacked by the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland") at the 1807 [Battle of Copenhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Copenhagen_(1807) "Battle of Copenhagen (1807)"), it entered into an alliance with [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon "Napoleon"), with the war leading to dire conditions and mass [starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation "Starvation") in 1812. As the Danish kingdom was on the losing side in 1814, it was forced by the [Treaty of Kiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Kiel "Treaty of Kiel") to cede Norway to Sweden, while the old Norwegian provinces of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands remained with the Danish crown.[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-69) Norway took this opportunity to declare independence, adopted a constitution based on [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution "United States Constitution") and [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_France "Constitution of France") models, and elected the Crown Prince of Denmark and Norway, [Christian Frederick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_VIII_of_Denmark "Christian VIII of Denmark"), as king on 17 May 1814 – celebrated as the [Syttende mai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Constitution_Day "Norwegian Constitution Day") (Seventeenth of May) holiday.

Norwegian opposition to the decision to link Norway with Sweden caused the [Norwegian–Swedish War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish%E2%80%93Norwegian_War_(1814) "Swedish–Norwegian War (1814)") to break out as Sweden tried to subdue Norway by military means. As Sweden's military was not strong enough to defeat the Norwegian forces outright, and Norway's treasury was not large enough to support a protracted war, and as British and Russian navies blockaded the Norwegian coast,[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-70) the belligerents were forced to negotiate the [Convention of Moss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_Moss "Convention of Moss"). Christian Frederik abdicated the Norwegian throne and authorised the [Parliament of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Norway "Parliament of Norway") to make the necessary constitutional amendments to allow for the [personal union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_union "Personal union") that Norway was forced to accept. On 4 November 1814, the Parliament (Storting) elected [Charles XIII of Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XIII_of_Sweden "Charles XIII of Sweden") as king of Norway, thereby establishing the [union with Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_between_Sweden_and_Norway "Union between Sweden and Norway").[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-71) Under this arrangement, Norway kept its liberal constitution and its own independent institutions, though it shared a monarch and foreign policy with Sweden. Following the recession caused by the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars"), economic development of Norway remained slow until 1830.[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-72)

This period also saw the rise of [Norwegian romantic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_romantic_nationalism "Norwegian romantic nationalism"), as Norwegians sought to define and express a distinct national character. The movement covered all branches of culture, including literature ([Henrik Wergeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Wergeland "Henrik Wergeland"), [Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rnstjerne_Bj%C3%B8rnson "Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson"), [Peter Christen Asbjørnsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Christen_Asbj%C3%B8rnsen "Peter Christen Asbjørnsen"), [Jørgen Moe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B8rgen_Moe "Jørgen Moe")), painting ([Hans Gude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Gude "Hans Gude"), [Adolph Tidemand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolph_Tidemand "Adolph Tidemand")), music ([Edvard Grieg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Grieg "Edvard Grieg")), and even language policy, where attempts to define a native written language for Norway led to today's two official written forms for Norwegian: [Bokmål](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokm%C3%A5l "Bokmål") and [Nynorsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nynorsk "Nynorsk").

[King Charles III John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XIV_John_of_Sweden "Charles XIV John of Sweden") came to the throne of Norway and Sweden in 1818 and reigned to 1844. He protected the constitution and liberties of Norway and Sweden during the age of [Metternich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klemens_Wenzel,_Prince_von_Metternich "Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich").\[_[neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view "Wikipedia:Neutral point of view") is [disputed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Norway#Added_WP:NPOV_tag "Talk:Norway")_\] As such, he was regarded as a liberal monarch. However, he was ruthless in his use of paid informers, secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press to put down public movements for reform—especially the Norwegian national independence movement.[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-73)

The [Romantic Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism "Romanticism") that followed the reign of Charles III John brought some significant social and political reforms. In 1854, women won the right to inherit property. In 1863, the last trace of keeping unmarried women in the status of minors was removed. Furthermore, women were eligible for different occupations, particularly the common school teacher.[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-74) By mid-century, Norway's democracy was limited; voting was limited to officials, property owners, leaseholders and burghers of incorporated towns.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-75)

[![Image 210](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Saami_Family_1900.jpg/220px-Saami_Family_1900.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Saami_Family_1900.jpg)

A [Sámi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_people "Sámi people") family in Norway, c. 1900

Norway remained a conservative society. Life in Norway (especially economic life) was "dominated by the aristocracy of professional men who filled most of the important posts in the central government".[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-76) There was no strong bourgeois class to demand a breakdown of this aristocratic control.[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Marx_Engels-77) Thus, even while revolution swept over most of the countries of Europe in 1848, Norway was largely unaffected.[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Marx_Engels-77)

[Marcus Thrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Thrane "Marcus Thrane") was a [Utopian socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian_socialism "Utopian socialism") who in 1848 organised a labour society in [Drammen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drammen_(town) "Drammen (town)"). In just a few months, this society had a membership of 500 and was publishing its own newspaper. Within two years, 300 societies had been organised all over Norway, with a total membership of 20,000 drawn from the lower classes of both urban and rural areas.[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-78) In the end, the revolt was easily crushed; Thrane was captured and jailed.[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-79)

In 1898, all men were granted [universal suffrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage "Universal suffrage"), followed by all [women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage "Women's suffrage") in 1913.

### Dissolution of the union and the First World War

[Christian Michelsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Michelsen "Christian Michelsen"), Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907, played a central role in the peaceful separation of Norway from Sweden on 7 June 1905. A national referendum confirmed the people's preference for a monarchy over a republic. However, no Norwegian could legitimately claim the throne, since none of Norway's noble families could claim [royal descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_descent "Royal descent").

The government then offered the throne of Norway to Prince Carl of Denmark, a prince of the Dano-German royal [house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl%C3%BCcksburg "House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg") and a distant relative of Norway's medieval kings. Following the plebiscite, he was unanimously elected king by the Norwegian [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Norway "Parliament of Norway"); he took the name [Haakon VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon_VII_of_Norway "Haakon VII of Norway").

Throughout the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), Norway remained neutral; however, diplomatic pressure from the [British government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom "Government of the United Kingdom") meant that it heavily favoured the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I "Allies of World War I"). During the war, Norway exported fish to both Germany and Britain, until an [ultimatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum "Ultimatum") from the British government and [anti-German sentiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-German_sentiment "Anti-German sentiment") as a result of [German submarines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat "U-boat") [targeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_submarine_warfare "Unrestricted submarine warfare") Norwegian merchantmen led to a termination of trade with Germany. 436 Norwegian merchantmen were sunk by the _[Kaiserliche Marine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_German_Navy "Imperial German Navy")_, with 1,150 Norwegian sailors killed.[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-80)\[_[disputed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Disputed_statement "Wikipedia:Disputed statement") – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Norway "Talk:Norway")_\]

### Second World War

Norway once more proclaimed its neutrality during the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), but was [invaded by German forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Weser%C3%BCbung "Operation Weserübung") on 9 April 1940. Although Norway was unprepared for the German surprise attack (see: [Battle of Drøbak Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dr%C3%B8bak_Sound "Battle of Drøbak Sound"), [Norwegian Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Campaign "Norwegian Campaign"), and [Invasion of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Weser%C3%BCbung "Operation Weserübung")), military and naval resistance lasted for two months. Norwegian armed forces in the north launched an offensive against the German forces in the [Battles of Narvik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Narvik "Battles of Narvik"), but were forced to surrender on 10 June after losing British support which had been diverted to France during the [German invasion of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France "Battle of France").

[![Image 211](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Bombingen_av_Kristiansund%2C_1940%2C_Riksarkivet%2C_Arkivreferanse_PA_1667U2_050.jpg/220px-Bombingen_av_Kristiansund%2C_1940%2C_Riksarkivet%2C_Arkivreferanse_PA_1667U2_050.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bombingen_av_Kristiansund,_1940,_Riksarkivet,_Arkivreferanse_PA_1667U2_050.jpg)

Bombing of [Kristiansund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristiansund "Kristiansund"). The German invasion resulted in 24 towns being bombed in the spring of 1940.

King Haakon and the Norwegian government escaped to [Rotherhithe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherhithe "Rotherhithe") in London. Throughout the war they sent radio speeches and supported clandestine military actions against the Germans. On the day of the invasion, the leader of the small National-Socialist party [Nasjonal Samling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasjonal_Samling "Nasjonal Samling"), [Vidkun Quisling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidkun_Quisling "Vidkun Quisling"), tried to seize power, but was forced by the German occupiers to step aside. Real power was wielded by the leader of the German occupation authority, [Josef Terboven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Terboven "Josef Terboven"). Quisling, as _minister president_, later formed a [collaborationist government under German control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quisling_regime "Quisling regime"). Up to 15,000 Norwegians volunteered to fight in German units, including the [Waffen-SS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffen-SS "Waffen-SS").[\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-81)

Many Norwegians and persons of Norwegian descent joined the Allied forces as well as the [Free Norwegian Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Norwegian_Forces "Free Norwegian Forces"). In June 1940, a small group had left Norway following their king to Britain. This group included 13 ships, five aircraft, and 500 men from the Royal Norwegian Navy. By the end of the war, the force had grown to 58 ships and 7,500 men in service in the Royal Norwegian Navy, 5 squadrons of aircraft in the newly formed Norwegian Air Force, and land forces including the [Norwegian Independent Company 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Independent_Company_1 "Norwegian Independent Company 1") and 5 Troop as well as No. 10 [Commandos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Commandos "British Commandos").\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

During [German occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Norway "German occupation of Norway"), Norwegians built a [resistance movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_resistance_movement "Norwegian resistance movement") which incorporated civil disobedience and armed resistance including the destruction of [Norsk Hydro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norsk_Hydro "Norsk Hydro")'s [heavy water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water "Heavy water") plant and stockpile of heavy water at [Vemork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vemork "Vemork"), which [crippled the German nuclear programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_heavy_water_sabotage "Norwegian heavy water sabotage"). More important to the [Allied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") war effort, however, was the role of the Norwegian [Merchant Marine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Navy "Merchant Navy"), the fourth-largest merchant marine fleet in the world. It was led by the Norwegian shipping company [Nortraship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nortraship "Nortraship") under the Allies throughout the war and took part in every war operation from the [evacuation of Dunkirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation "Dunkirk evacuation") to the [Normandy landings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings "Normandy landings"). Every December Norway gives a [Christmas tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree "Christmas tree") to the United Kingdom as thanks for the British assistance during the war.[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-82)

[Svalbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard "Svalbard") was not occupied by German troops, but Germany secretly [established a meteorological station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Haudegen "Operation Haudegen") there in 1944.[\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-83)

### Post–World War II history

[![Image 212](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/StatfjordA%28Jarvin1982%29.jpg/220px-StatfjordA%28Jarvin1982%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:StatfjordA(Jarvin1982).jpg)

Since the 1970s oil production has helped to expand the Norwegian economy and finance the Norwegian state ([Statfjord oil field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statfjord_oil_field "Statfjord oil field")).

From 1945 to 1962, the [Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(Norway) "Labour Party (Norway)") held an absolute majority in the parliament. The government, led by prime minister [Einar Gerhardsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einar_Gerhardsen "Einar Gerhardsen"), embarked on a programme inspired by [Keynesian economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics "Keynesian economics"), emphasising state financed [industrialisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation "Industrialisation") and co-operation between trade unions and [employers' organisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employers%27_organisation "Employers' organisation"). Many measures of state control of the economy imposed during the war were continued, although the [rationing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing "Rationing") of dairy products was lifted in 1949, while price controls and rationing of housing and cars continued until 1960.

The wartime alliance with the United Kingdom and the United States continued in the post-war years. Although pursuing the goal of a socialist economy, the Labour Party distanced itself from the Communists, especially after the Communists' seizure of power in [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia "Czechoslovakia") in 1948, and strengthened its foreign policy and defence policy ties with the US. Norway received [Marshall Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan "Marshall Plan") aid from the United States starting in 1947, joined the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development") (OECD) one year later, and became a founding member of the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO") (NATO) in 1949.

Oil was discovered at the small Balder field in 1967, but production only began in 1999.[\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-84) In 1969, the [Phillips Petroleum Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_Petroleum_Company "Phillips Petroleum Company") discovered petroleum resources at the [Ekofisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekofisk_oil_field "Ekofisk oil field") field west of Norway. In 1973, the Norwegian government founded the State oil company, Statoil (now [Equinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinor "Equinor")). Oil production did not provide net income until the early 1980s because of the large capital investment required. Around 1975, both the proportion and absolute number of workers in industry peaked. Since then labour-intensive industries and services like factory mass production and shipping have largely been outsourced.

Norway was a founding member of the [European Free Trade Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association "European Free Trade Association") (EFTA). Norway was twice invited to join the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union"), but ultimately declined after referendums that failed by narrow margins in [1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Norwegian_European_Communities_membership_referendum "1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum") and [1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Norwegian_European_Union_membership_referendum "1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum").[\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-85)

[![Image 213](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/2011_Norway_attacks_flower_march_2.jpg/220px-2011_Norway_attacks_flower_march_2.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2011_Norway_attacks_flower_march_2.jpg)

Town Hall Square in Oslo filled with people with roses mourning the victims of the [Utøya massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Norway_attacks#Ut%C3%B8ya_mass_shooting "2011 Norway attacks") of 22 July 2011.

In 1981, a [Conservative Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(Norway) "Conservative Party (Norway)") government led by [Kåre Willoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A5re_Willoch "Kåre Willoch") replaced the Labour Party with a policy of stimulating the [stagflated economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation "Stagflation") with tax cuts, economic liberalisation, deregulation of markets, and measures to curb record-high inflation (13.6% in 1981).

Norway's first female prime minister [Gro Harlem Brundtland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro_Harlem_Brundtland "Gro Harlem Brundtland") of the Labour Party continued many of the reforms, while backing traditional Labour concerns such as [social security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_security "Social security"), high taxes, the industrialisation of nature, and feminism. By the late 1990s, Norway had paid off its foreign debt and had started accumulating a [sovereign wealth fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_wealth_fund "Sovereign wealth fund"). Since the 1990s, a divisive question in politics has been how much of the income from petroleum production the government should spend, and how much it should save.

In 2011, Norway suffered [two terrorist attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Norway_attacks "2011 Norway attacks") by [Anders Behring Breivik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik "Anders Behring Breivik") which struck the [government quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regjeringskvartalet "Regjeringskvartalet") in Oslo and a summer camp of the Labour party's [youth movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_Youth_League_(Norway) "Workers' Youth League (Norway)") at [Utøya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ut%C3%B8ya "Utøya") island, resulting in 77 deaths and 319 wounded.[\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-86)

[Jens Stoltenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg "Jens Stoltenberg") led Norway as prime minister for eight years from 2005 to 2013.[\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-87) The [2013 Norwegian parliamentary election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Norwegian_parliamentary_election "2013 Norwegian parliamentary election") brought a more conservative government to power, with the Conservative Party and the [Progress Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_Party_(Norway) "Progress Party (Norway)") winning 43% of the electorate's votes.[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-88) In the [Norwegian parliamentary election 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Norwegian_parliamentary_election "2017 Norwegian parliamentary election") the centre-right government of Prime Minister [Erna Solberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erna_Solberg "Erna Solberg") won re-election.[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-reuters.com-89) The [2021 Norwegian parliamentary election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Norwegian_parliamentary_election "2021 Norwegian parliamentary election") saw a big win for the left-wing opposition in an election fought on climate change, inequality, and oil;[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-90) Labour leader [Jonas Gahr Støre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Gahr_St%C3%B8re "Jonas Gahr Støre") was sworn in as prime minister.[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-91)

Norway's core territory comprises the western and northernmost portion of the [Scandinavian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Peninsula "Scandinavian Peninsula"); the remote island of [Jan Mayen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Mayen "Jan Mayen") and the archipelago of [Svalbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard "Svalbard") are also included.[\[note 5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Svalbard-26) The Antarctic [Peter I Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_I_Island "Peter I Island") and the sub-Antarctic [Bouvet Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouvet_Island "Bouvet Island") are [dependent territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependencies_of_Norway "Dependencies of Norway") and thus not considered part of the Kingdom.

The coastline of the mainland including fjords stretches 28,953 kilometres (17,991 mi), when islands are included the coastline has been estimated to 100,915 kilometres (62,706 mi).[\[92\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-99) Norway shares a 1,619-kilometre (1,006 mi) land border with Sweden, 727 kilometres (452 mi) with Finland, and 196 kilometres (122 mi) with Russia to the east. To the north, west and south, Norway is bordered by the [Barents Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barents_Sea "Barents Sea"), the [Norwegian Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Sea "Norwegian Sea"), the [North Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea "North Sea"), and [Skagerrak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skagerrak "Skagerrak").[\[93\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-factbook-100) The [Scandinavian Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Mountains "Scandinavian Mountains") form much of the border with Sweden.

At 385,207 square kilometres (148,729 sq mi) (including [Svalbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard "Svalbard") and [Jan Mayen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Mayen "Jan Mayen"); 323,808 square kilometres (125,023 sq mi) without),[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-kart_2019-17) much of the country is dominated by mountainous or high terrain, with a great variety of natural features caused by prehistoric [glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier") and varied [topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography "Topography"). The most noticeable of these are the fjords. [Sognefjorden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sognefjorden "Sognefjorden") is the world's second deepest fjord, and the world's longest at 204 kilometres (127 mi). The lake [Hornindalsvatnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornindalsvatnet "Hornindalsvatnet") is the deepest lake in Europe.[\[94\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-101) Norway has about 400,000 lakes[\[95\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-102)[\[96\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-103) and 239,057 registered islands.[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-SNL-96) [Permafrost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost "Permafrost") can be found all year in the higher mountain areas and in the interior of Finnmark county. [Numerous glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_glaciers_in_Norway "List of glaciers in Norway") are found in Norway. The land is mostly made of hard [granite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite "Granite") and [gneiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gneiss "Gneiss") rock, but [slate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate "Slate"), [sandstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone "Sandstone"), and [limestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") are also common, and the lowest elevations contain marine deposits.

[![Image 216](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Precipitation_normal_Norway.jpg/220px-Precipitation_normal_Norway.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Precipitation_normal_Norway.jpg)

Map of Norway showing the normal precipitation (annual average). Period 1961–1990.

Because of the [Gulf Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream "Gulf Stream") and prevailing westerlies, Norway experiences higher temperatures and more precipitation than expected at such northern latitudes, especially along the coast. The mainland experiences four distinct seasons, with colder winters and less precipitation inland. The northernmost part has a mostly maritime [Subarctic climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarctic_climate "Subarctic climate"), while Svalbard has an [Arctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic "Arctic") [tundra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra "Tundra") climate. The southern and western parts of Norway, fully exposed to Atlantic storm fronts, experience more precipitation and have milder winters than the eastern and far northern parts. Areas to the east of the coastal mountains are in a [rain shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_shadow "Rain shadow"), and have lower rain and snow totals than the west. The lowlands around Oslo have the warmest summers, but also cold weather and snow in wintertime. The sunniest weather is along the south coast, but sometimes even the coast far north can be very sunny – the sunniest month with 430 sun hours was recorded in Tromsø.[\[97\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Norwegian-Meteorological-Institute-104)[\[98\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Book-Climate-105)

Because of Norway's high [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude"), there are large seasonal variations in daylight. From late May to late July, the sun never completely descends beneath the horizon in areas north of the [Arctic Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle "Arctic Circle"), and the rest of the country experiences up to 20 hours of daylight per day. Conversely, from late November to late January, the sun never rises above the horizon in the north, and daylight hours are very short in the rest of the country.

Temperature anomalies found in coastal locations are exceptional, with southern Lofoten and [Bø Municipality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B8_Municipality_(Nordland) "Bø Municipality (Nordland)") having all monthly means above freezing in spite of being north of the Arctic Circle. The very northernmost coast of Norway would be ice-covered in winter if not for the Gulf Stream.[\[99\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-106) The east of the country has a more continental climate, and the mountain ranges have subarctic and tundra climates. There is also higher rainfall in areas exposed to the Atlantic, especially the western slopes of the mountain ranges and areas close, such as Bergen. The valleys east of the mountain ranges are the driest; some of the valleys are sheltered by mountains in most directions. [Saltdal Municipality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltdal_Municipality "Saltdal Municipality") in Nordland is the driest place with 211 millimetres (8.3 inches) precipitation annually (1991–2020). In southern Norway, [Skjåk Municipality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skj%C3%A5k_Municipality "Skjåk Municipality") in Innlandet county gets 295 millimetres (11.6 inches) precipitation. [Finnmarksvidda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnmarksvidda "Finnmarksvidda") and some interior valleys of [Troms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troms "Troms") county receive around 400 millimetres (16 inches) annually, and the high Arctic [Longyearbyen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longyearbyen "Longyearbyen") 217 millimetres (8.5 inches).[\[100\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-107)

Parts of southeastern Norway including parts of [Mjøsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mj%C3%B8sa "Mjøsa") have a [humid continental climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_continental_climate "Humid continental climate") ([Köppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification") Dfb), the southern and western coasts and also the coast north to Bodø have an [oceanic climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_climate "Oceanic climate") (Cfb), and the outer coast further north almost to North Cape has a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc). Further inland in the south and at higher altitudes, and also in much of Northern Norway, the [subarctic climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarctic_climate "Subarctic climate") (Dfc) dominates. A small strip of land along the coast east of North Cape (including Vardø) earlier had [tundra/alpine/polar climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_climate "Polar climate") (ET), but this is mostly gone with the updated 1991–2020 climate normals, making this also subarctic. Large parts of Norway are covered by mountains and high altitude plateaus, and about one third of the land is above the treeline and thus exhibit [tundra/alpine/polar climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra_climate "Tundra climate") (ET).[\[97\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Norwegian-Meteorological-Institute-104)[\[101\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-108)[\[102\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-109)[\[98\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Book-Climate-105)[\[103\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-110)

A Norwegian [moose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose "Moose"), called _elg_ in Norwegian.

Norway has a larger number of different [habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat "Habitat") than almost any other European country. There are approximately 60,000 species in Norway and adjacent waters (excluding bacteria and viruses). The Norwegian Shelf large marine ecosystem is considered highly productive.[\[104\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-111) The total number of species include 16,000 species of insects (probably 4,000 more species yet to be described), 20,000 species of [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae "Algae"), 1,800 species of [lichen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen "Lichen"), 1,050 species of [mosses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss "Moss"), 2,800 species of [vascular plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_plant "Vascular plant"), up to 7,000 species of [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus "Fungus"), 450 species of birds (250 species nesting in Norway), 90 species of mammals, 45 fresh-water species of fish, 150 salt-water species of fish, 1,000 species of fresh-water [invertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate "Invertebrate"), and 3,500 species of salt-water invertebrates.[\[105\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-112) About 40,000 of these species have been described by science. The [red list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List "IUCN Red List") of 2010 encompasses 4,599 species.[\[106\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-red-113) Norway contains five terrestrial ecoregions: [Sarmatic mixed forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarmatic_mixed_forests "Sarmatic mixed forests"), [Scandinavian coastal conifer forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_coastal_conifer_forests "Scandinavian coastal conifer forests"), [Scandinavian and Russian taiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_and_Russian_taiga "Scandinavian and Russian taiga"), [Kola Peninsula tundra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Peninsula_tundra "Kola Peninsula tundra"), and [Scandinavian montane birch forest and grasslands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_montane_birch_forest_and_grasslands "Scandinavian montane birch forest and grasslands").[\[107\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-DinersteinOlson2017-114)

Seventeen species are listed mainly because they are endangered on a global scale, such as the [European beaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_beaver "Eurasian beaver"), even if the population in Norway is not seen as endangered. The number of threatened and near-threatened species equals to 3,682; it includes 418 fungi species, many of which are closely associated with the small remaining old-growth forests,[\[108\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-115) 36 bird species, and 16 species of mammals. In 2010, 2,398 species were listed as endangered or vulnerable; of these 1,250 were listed as vulnerable (VU), 871 as endangered (EN), and 276 species as critically endangered (CR), among which were the [grey wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_wolf "Grey wolf"), the [Arctic fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_fox "Arctic fox"), and the [pool frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_frog "Pool frog").[\[106\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-red-113)

The largest predator in Norwegian waters is the [sperm whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale "Sperm whale"), and the largest fish is the [basking shark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basking_shark "Basking shark"). The largest predator on land is the [polar bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear "Polar bear"), while the [brown bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear "Brown bear") is the largest predator on the Norwegian mainland. The largest land animal on the mainland is the elk (American English: [moose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose "Moose")).

### Environment

Attractive and dramatic scenery and landscape are found throughout Norway.[\[109\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-116) The west coast of southern Norway and the coast of northern Norway present some of the most visually impressive coastal sceneries in the world. [National Geographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic_Society "National Geographic Society") has listed the Norwegian fjords as the world's top tourist attraction.[\[110\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-117) The country is also home to the natural phenomena of the Midnight sun (during summer), as well as the [Aurora borealis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora "Aurora") known also as the Northern lights.[\[111\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-118)

The 2016 [Environmental Performance Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Performance_Index "Environmental Performance Index") from [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University "Yale University"), [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University") and the [World Economic Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum "World Economic Forum") put Norway in seventeenth place, immediately below Croatia and Switzerland.[\[112\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-epi-119) The index is based on environmental risks to human health, habitat loss, and changes in CO2 emissions. The index notes over-exploitation of fisheries, but not [Norway's whaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling_in_Norway "Whaling in Norway") or [oil exports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_Norway "Energy in Norway").[\[113\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-indi-120) Norway had a 2019 [Forest Landscape Integrity Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Landscape_Integrity_Index "Forest Landscape Integrity Index") mean score of 6.98/10, ranking it 60th globally out of 172 countries.[\[114\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-FLII-Supplementary-121)

_[The Storting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storting_building "Storting building")_ is the [Parliament of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Norway "Parliament of Norway").

Norway is considered to be one of the most developed democracies and [states of justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechtsstaat "Rechtsstaat") in the world. Since 2010, Norway has been classified as the world's most democratic country by the [Democracy Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index "Democracy Index").[\[115\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-122)[\[116\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-123)[\[117\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-124)

According to the [Constitution of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Norway "Constitution of Norway"), which was adopted on 17 May 1814[\[118\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Constitution-125) and was inspired by the [United States Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence "United States Declaration of Independence") and [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution"), Norway is a unitary [constitutional monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy "Constitutional monarchy") with a [parliamentary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system "Parliamentary system") of government, wherein the [King of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Norway "Monarchy of Norway") is the [head of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state "Head of state") and the [prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Norway "Prime Minister of Norway") is the [head of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government "Head of government"). Power is separated among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, as defined by the Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.

The [monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Royal_Family "Norwegian Royal Family") officially retains executive power. But following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government, the duties of the monarch became strictly representative and ceremonial.[\[119\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-126) The Monarch is [commander-in-chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief "Commander-in-chief") of the [Norwegian Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Armed_Forces "Norwegian Armed Forces"), and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad and as a symbol of unity. [Harald V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_V_of_Norway "Harald V of Norway") of the [House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Gl%C3%BCcksburg "House of Glücksburg") ascended to the Norwegian throne in 1991, the first since the 14th century who has been born in the country.[\[120\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-norway.org-127) [Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon,_Crown_Prince_of_Norway "Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway"), is the heir to the throne.

In practice, the Prime Minister exercises the executive powers. Constitutionally, legislative power is vested with both the government and the Parliament of Norway, but the latter is the supreme legislature and a [unicameral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicameralism "Unicameralism") body.[\[121\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-128) Norway is fundamentally structured as a [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy"). The Parliament can pass a law by simple majority of the 169 representatives, of which 150 are elected directly from 19 constituencies, and an additional 19 seats ("levelling seats") are allocated on a nationwide basis to make the representation in parliament correspond better with the popular vote for the political parties. A 4% election threshold is required for a party to gain levelling seats in Parliament.[\[122\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Election_threshold-129)

The Parliament of Norway, called the _[Storting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Norway "Parliament of Norway")_, ratifies national [treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty "Treaty") developed by the executive branch. It can [impeach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment "Impeachment") members of the government if their acts are declared unconstitutional. If an indicted suspect is impeached, Parliament has the power to remove the person from office.

The position of [prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Norway "Prime Minister of Norway") is allocated to the member of Parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in Parliament, usually the current leader of the largest political party or, more effectively, through a coalition of parties; Norway has often been ruled by minority governments. The prime minister nominates the cabinet, traditionally drawn from members of the same political party or parties in the Storting, making up the government. The PM organises the executive government and exercises its power as vested by the Constitution.[\[123\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-130)

Norway has a state church, the Lutheran [Church of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Norway "Church of Norway"), which has gradually been granted more internal autonomy in day-to-day affairs, but which still has a special constitutional status. Formerly, the PM had to have more than half the members of cabinet be members of the Church of Norway; this rule was removed in 2012. The issue of [separation of church and state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state "Separation of church and state") in Norway has been increasingly controversial. A part of this is the evolution of the public school subject Christianity, a required subject since 1739. Even the state's loss in a battle at the [European Court of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights "European Court of Human Rights") at [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg "Strasbourg")[\[124\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-131) in 2007 did not settle the matter. As of 1 January 2017, the Church of Norway is a separate legal entity, and no longer a branch of the civil service.[\[125\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-132) Through the [Council of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Council_of_State "Norwegian Council of State"), a [privy council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privy_council "Privy council") presided over by the monarch, the prime minister and the cabinet meet at the [Royal Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Palace,_Oslo "Royal Palace, Oslo") and formally consult the Monarch. All government bills need formal approval by the monarch before and after introduction to Parliament. The Council approves all of the monarch's actions as head of state.[\[120\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-norway.org-127)

Members of the Storting are directly elected from [party-list proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation "Party-list proportional representation") in nineteen [plural-member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting_system "Plurality voting system") constituencies in a national [multi-party system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_system "Multi-party system").[\[126\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-133) Historically, both the [Norwegian Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Labour_Party "Norwegian Labour Party") and [Conservative Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(Norway) "Conservative Party (Norway)") have played leading political roles. In the early 21st century, the Labour Party has been in power since the [2005 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Norwegian_parliamentary_election "2005 Norwegian parliamentary election"), in a [Red–Green Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red%E2%80%93Green_Coalition&action=edit&redlink=1 "Red–Green Coalition (page does not exist)") with the [Socialist Left Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Left_Party_(Norway) "Socialist Left Party (Norway)") and the [Centre Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Party_(Norway) "Centre Party (Norway)").[\[127\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-134) Since 2005, both the Conservative Party and the [Progress Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_Party_(Norway) "Progress Party (Norway)") have won numerous seats in the Parliament.[\[128\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-135)

In national elections in September 2013, two political parties, [Høyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B8yre "Høyre") and [Fremskrittspartiet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_Party_(Norway) "Progress Party (Norway)"), were elected on promises of tax cuts, more spending on infrastructure and education, better services and stricter rules on immigration, formed a government. [Erna Solberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erna_Solberg "Erna Solberg") became prime minister, the second female prime minister after [Gro Harlem Brundtland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro_Harlem_Brundtland "Gro Harlem Brundtland") and the first conservative prime minister since [Jan P. Syse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_P._Syse "Jan P. Syse"). Solberg said her win was "a historic election victory for the right-wing parties".[\[129\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-136) Her centre-right government won re-election in the [2017 Norwegian parliamentary election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Norwegian_parliamentary_election "2017 Norwegian parliamentary election").[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-reuters.com-89) Norway's new centre-left cabinet under Prime Minister [Jonas Gahr Støre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Gahr_St%C3%B8re "Jonas Gahr Støre"), the leader the Labour Party, took office on 14 October 2021.[\[130\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-137)

A municipal and regional reform: "From 14 June 2022, the Storting decided the following division of counties."

Norway, a [unitary state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state "Unitary state"), is divided into fifteen first-level administrative [counties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County "County") (_fylke_).[\[131\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-138) The counties are administered through directly elected [county councils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_municipality_(Norway) "County municipality (Norway)") who elect the [County Mayor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_mayor "County mayor"). Additionally, the [King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Royal_Family "Norwegian Royal Family") and government are represented in every county by a [County Governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_governor_(Norway) "County governor (Norway)") ([Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language "Norwegian language"): _statsforvalteren_).[\[132\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-139) The counties are then sub-divided into 357 second-level municipalities ([Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language "Norwegian language"): _kommuner_), which in turn are administered by directly elected [municipal council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_council_(Norway) "Municipal council (Norway)"), headed by a mayor and a small executive cabinet. The capital of [Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo "Oslo") is considered both a county and a municipality. Norway has two integral overseas territories out of mainland: [Jan Mayen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Mayen "Jan Mayen") and [Svalbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard "Svalbard"), the only developed island in the archipelago of the same name, located far to the north of the Norwegian mainland.[\[133\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-140)

There are 108 settlements that have [town/city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_cities_in_Norway "List of towns and cities in Norway") status in Norway (the Norwegian word _by_ is used to represent these places and that word can be translated as either town or city in English). Cities/towns in Norway were historically designated by the King and used to have special rules and privileges under the law. This was changed in the late 20th century, so now towns/cities have no special rights and a municipality can designate an urban settlement as a city/town. Towns and cities in Norway do not have to be large. Some cities have over a million residents such as Oslo, while others are much smaller such as [Honningsvåg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honningsv%C3%A5g "Honningsvåg") with about 2,200 residents. Usually, there is only one town within a municipality, but there are some municipalities that have more than one town within it (such as [Larvik Municipality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larvik_Municipality "Larvik Municipality") which has the [town of Larvik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larvik_(town) "Larvik (town)") and the town of [Stavern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavern "Stavern").[\[134\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-byer-norge-141)

#### Dependencies of Norway

There are three [Antarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") and [Subantarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subantarctic "Subantarctic") [dependencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_territory "Dependent territory"): [Bouvet Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouvet_Island "Bouvet Island"), [Peter I Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_I_Island "Peter I Island"), and [Queen Maud Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Maud_Land "Queen Maud Land"). On most maps, there was an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land and the [South Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole "South Pole") until 12 June 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area.[\[135\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-142)

### Judicial system and law enforcement

Norway uses a [civil law system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system) "Civil law (legal system)") where laws are created and amended in Parliament and the system regulated through the [Courts of justice of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts_of_justice_of_Norway "Courts of justice of Norway"). It consists of the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Norway "Supreme Court of Norway") of 20 permanent judges and a [Chief Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_Norway "Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway"), [appellate courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court "Appellate court"), city and [district courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts_of_justice_of_Norway#District_courts "Courts of justice of Norway"), and [conciliation councils](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conciliation_councils&action=edit&redlink=1 "Conciliation councils (page does not exist)").[\[136\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-norway-143) The judiciary is independent of executive and legislative branches. While the Prime Minister nominates Supreme Court Justices for office, their nomination must be approved by Parliament and formally confirmed by the Monarch. Usually, judges attached to regular courts are formally appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister.

The Courts' formal mission is to regulate the Norwegian judicial system, interpret the Constitution, and implement the legislation adopted by Parliament. In its judicial reviews, it monitors the legislative and executive branches to ensure that they comply with provisions of enacted legislation.[\[136\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-norway-143)

The [law is enforced in Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Norway "Law enforcement in Norway") by the [Norwegian Police Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Police_Service "Norwegian Police Service"). It is a Unified National Police Service made up of 27 Police Districts and several specialist agencies, such as [Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_National_Authority_for_the_Investigation_and_Prosecution_of_Economic_and_Environmental_Crime "Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime"), known as _Økokrim_; and the [National Criminal Investigation Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Criminal_Investigation_Service_(Norway) "National Criminal Investigation Service (Norway)"), known as _Kripos_, each headed by a chief of police. The Police Service is headed by the [National Police Directorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Directorate "National Police Directorate"), which reports to the Ministry of Justice and the Police. The Police Directorate is headed by a National Police Commissioner. The only exception is the [Norwegian Police Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Police_Security_Service "Norwegian Police Security Service"), whose head answers directly to the Ministry of Justice and the Police.

Norway abolished the death penalty for regular criminal acts in 1902 and for high treason in war and war-crimes in 1979. Norwegian prisons are humane, rather than tough, with emphasis on rehabilitation. At 20%, Norway's re-conviction rate is among the lowest in the world.[\[137\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-144)

[Reporters Without Borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders "Reporters Without Borders"), in its 2023 [World Press Freedom Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Index "World Press Freedom Index"), ranked Norway in first place out of 180 countries.[\[138\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-145) In general, the legal and institutional framework in Norway is characterised by a high degree of transparency, accountability and integrity, and the perception and the occurrence of corruption are very low.[\[139\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-146)

### Human rights

Norway has been considered a progressive country, which has adopted legislation and policies to support women's rights, minority rights, and [LGBT rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Norway "LGBT rights in Norway"). As early as 1884, 171 of the leading figures, among them five Prime Ministers, co-founded the [Norwegian Association for Women's Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Association_for_Women%27s_Rights "Norwegian Association for Women's Rights").[\[140\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-147) They successfully campaigned for women's [right to education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_education "Right to education"), [women's suffrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage "Women's suffrage"), the [right to work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_work "Right to work"), and other gender equality policies. From the 1970s, gender equality also came high on the state agenda, with the establishment of a public body to promote gender equality, which evolved into the [Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Equality_and_Anti-Discrimination_Ombud "Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud"). Civil society organisations also continue to play an important role; women's rights organisations are today organised in the [Norwegian Women's Lobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Women%27s_Lobby "Norwegian Women's Lobby") umbrella organisation.

In 1990, the Norwegian constitution was amended to grant [absolute primogeniture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_primogeniture "Absolute primogeniture") to the Norwegian throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence in the line of succession. As it was not retroactive, the current successor to the throne is the eldest son of the King, rather than his eldest child.[\[141\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-148)

The Sámi people have for centuries been the subject of discrimination and abuse by the dominant cultures in Scandinavia and Russia, those countries claiming possession of Sámi lands.[\[142\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-149) Norway has been greatly criticised by the international community for the politics of [Norwegianization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegianization "Norwegianization") of and discrimination against the indigenous population of the country.[\[143\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-150) Nevertheless, Norway was, in 1990, the first country to recognise [ILO-convention 169](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_and_Tribal_Peoples_Convention,_1989 "Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989") on [indigenous people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_people "Indigenous people") recommended by the UN.

Norway was the first country in the world to enact an anti-discrimination law protecting the rights of gay men and lesbians. In 1993, Norway became the second country to legalise [civil union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_union "Civil union") partnerships for same-sex couples, and on 1 January 2009, [Norway became the sixth country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Norway "Same-sex marriage in Norway") to legalise [same-sex marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage "Same-sex marriage").[\[144\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-151) As a promoter of human rights, Norway has held the annual [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Freedom_Forum "Oslo Freedom Forum") conference, a gathering described by _[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist "The Economist")_ as "on its way to becoming a human-rights equivalent of the Davos economic forum".[\[145\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-152)

Norway maintains embassies in 82 countries.[\[146\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-153) 60 countries maintain an embassy in Norway, all of them in the capital, Oslo.

Norway is a founding member of the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") (UN), the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO") (NATO), the [Council of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe "Council of Europe") and the [European Free Trade Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association "European Free Trade Association") (EFTA). Norway issued applications for accession to the European Union (EU) and its predecessors in 1962, 1967 and 1992, respectively. While Denmark, Sweden and Finland obtained membership, the Norwegian electorate rejected the treaties of accession in referendums in [1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Norwegian_European_Communities_membership_referendum "1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum") and [1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Norwegian_European_Union_membership_referendum "1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum").

After the 1994 referendum, Norway maintained its membership in the [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area "European Economic Area") (EEA), granting the country access to the [internal market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market_of_the_European_Union "Single market of the European Union") of the Union, on the condition that Norway implements the Union's pieces of legislation which are deemed relevant.[\[147\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-154) Successive Norwegian governments have, since 1994, requested participation in parts of the EU's co-operation that go beyond the provisions of the EEA agreement. Non-voting participation by Norway has been granted in, for instance, the Union's [Common Security and Defence Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy "Common Security and Defence Policy"), the [Schengen Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement "Schengen Agreement"), and the [European Defence Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Defence_Agency "European Defence Agency"), as well as 19 separate programmes.[\[148\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-155)

Norway participated in the 1990s brokering of the [Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords "Oslo Accords"), an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the [Israeli–Palestinian conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict "Israeli–Palestinian conflict").

### Military

The first Norwegian [F-35 Lightning II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-35_Lightning_II "F-35 Lightning II") lands at Luke Air Force Base.

The Norwegian Armed Forces numbers about 25,000 personnel, including civilian employees. According to 2009 mobilisation plans, full mobilisation produces approximately 83,000 combatant personnel. Norway has [conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription "Conscription") (including 6–12 months of training);[\[149\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-NDFnumbers-156) in 2013, the country became the first in Europe and NATO to draft women as well as men. However, due to less need for conscripts after the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"), few people have to serve if they are not motivated.[\[150\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-157) The Armed Forces are subordinate to the [Norwegian Ministry of Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Ministry_of_Defence "Norwegian Ministry of Defence"). The Commander-in-Chief is [King Harald V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_V_of_Norway "Harald V of Norway"). The military of Norway is divided into the [Norwegian Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Army "Norwegian Army"), the [Royal Norwegian Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Norwegian_Navy "Royal Norwegian Navy"), the [Royal Norwegian Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Norwegian_Air_Force "Royal Norwegian Air Force"), the [Norwegian Cyber Defence Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Cyber_Defence_Force "Norwegian Cyber Defence Force") and the [Home Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Guard_(Norway) "Home Guard (Norway)").

The country was one of the founding nations of the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO") (NATO) on 4 April 1949. Norway contributed in the [International Security Assistance Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force "International Security Assistance Force") (ISAF) in [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present) "War in Afghanistan (2001–present)").[\[151\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-158) Additionally, Norway has contributed in several missions in contexts of the United Nations, NATO, and the [Common Security and Defence Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy "Common Security and Defence Policy") of the European Union.

Members of the [European Free Trade Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association "European Free Trade Association") (green) participate in the [European Single Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Single_Market "European Single Market") and are part of the [Schengen Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area "Schengen Area").

Norwegians enjoy the second-highest [GDP per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita "List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita") among European countries (after [Luxembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg "Luxembourg")), and the sixth-highest [GDP (PPP) per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita "List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita") in the world. Norway ranks as the second-wealthiest country in monetary value, with the largest capital reserve per capita of any nation.[\[152\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-159) According to the CIA World Factbook, Norway is a net external creditor of debt.[\[93\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-factbook-100) Norway reclaimed first place in the world in the [UNDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme "United Nations Development Programme") [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index "Human Development Index") (HDI) in 2009.[\[153\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-autogenerated1-160) The standard of living in Norway is among the highest in the world. _[Foreign Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Policy "Foreign Policy")_ magazine ranks Norway last in its [Failed States Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Failed_States_Index "List of countries by Failed States Index") for 2009 and 2023, judging Norway to be the world's most well-functioning and stable country. The [OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD "OECD") ranks Norway fourth in the 2013 equalised [Better Life Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD_Better_Life_Index "OECD Better Life Index") and third in intergenerational earnings elasticity according to a 2010 study.[\[154\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-161)[\[155\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-OECD_Better_Life_Index-162)

The Norwegian economy is an example of a [mixed economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy "Mixed economy"); a prosperous capitalist [welfare state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state "Welfare state"), it features a combination of [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market") activity and large state ownership in certain key sectors, influenced by both liberal governments from the late 19th century and later by [social democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(Norway) "Labour Party (Norway)") governments in the postwar era.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] [Public healthcare in Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Norway "Healthcare in Norway") is free (after an annual charge of around 2000 [kroner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_krone "Norwegian krone") for those over 16), and parents have 46 weeks paid[\[156\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-163) parental leave. The state income derived from natural resources includes a significant contribution from petroleum production. As of 2016, Norway has an unemployment rate of 4.8%, with 68% of the population aged 15–74 employed.[\[157\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-164) People in the labour force are either employed or looking for work.[\[158\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-165) As of 2013, 9.5% of the population aged 18–66 receive a disability pension[\[159\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-166) and 30% of the labour force are employed by the government, the highest in the [OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD "OECD").[\[160\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-167) The hourly productivity levels, as well as average hourly wages in Norway, are among the highest in the world.[\[161\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-168)[\[162\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-169)

The [egalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism "Egalitarianism") values of Norwegian society have kept the wage difference between the lowest paid worker and the CEO of most companies as much less than in comparable western economies.[\[163\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-170) This is also evident in [Norway's low Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality "List of countries by income equality").

The state has large ownership positions in key industrial sectors, such as the strategic petroleum sector (Equinor), hydroelectric energy production ([Statkraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statkraft "Statkraft")), aluminium production ([Norsk Hydro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norsk_Hydro "Norsk Hydro")), the largest Norwegian bank ([DNB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNB_ASA "DNB ASA")), and telecommunication provider ([Telenor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenor "Telenor")). Through these big companies, the government controls approximately 30% of the stock values at the Oslo Stock Exchange. \[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] When non-listed companies are included, the state has even higher share in ownership (mainly from direct oil licence ownership).\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Norway is a major shipping nation and has the world's sixth largest [merchant fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_transport "Ship transport"), with 1,412 Norwegian-owned merchant vessels.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

By referendums in [1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Norwegian_European_Communities_membership_referendum "1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum") and [1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Norwegian_European_Union_membership_referendum "1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum"), Norwegians rejected proposals to join the European Union (EU). However, Norway, together with [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland "Iceland") and [Liechtenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein "Liechtenstein"), participates in the European Union's single market through the [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area "European Economic Area") (EEA) agreement. The EEA Treaty between the European Union countries and the EFTA countries—transposed into Norwegian law via "EØS-loven"[\[164\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-171)—describes the procedures for implementing European Union rules in Norway and the other EFTA countries. Norway is a highly integrated member of most sectors of the EU internal market. Some sectors, such as agriculture, oil and fish, are not wholly covered by the EEA Treaty. Norway has also acceded to the [Schengen Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement "Schengen Agreement") and several other intergovernmental agreements among the EU member states.

The country is richly endowed with natural resources including petroleum, [hydropower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower "Hydropower"), fish, [forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry "Forestry"), and minerals. Large reserves of petroleum and natural gas were discovered in the 1960s, which led to an economic boom.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Norway has obtained one of the highest standards of living in the world in part by having a large amount of natural resources compared to the size of the population.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] In 2011, 28% of state revenues were generated from the petroleum industry.[\[165\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-172)\[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_\]

Norway was the first country to ban deforestation, with a view to preventing its rain forests from vanishing. The country declared its intention at the UN Climate Summit in 2014 alongside Great Britain and Germany.[\[166\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-173)

Agriculture is a significant sector, in spite of the mountainous landscape ([Øysand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98ysand "Øysand")).

[![Image 234](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Stockfish_in_Lofoten.jpg/220px-Stockfish_in_Lofoten.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stockfish_in_Lofoten.jpg)

[Stockfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish "Stockfish") has been exported from [Lofoten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lofoten "Lofoten") in Norway for at least 1,000 years.

#### Oil industry

[![Image 235](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Heidrun%2C_Norskehavet_%2828276260560%29.jpg/220px-Heidrun%2C_Norskehavet_%2828276260560%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Heidrun,_Norskehavet_(28276260560).jpg)

Oil production has been central to the Norwegian economy since the 1970s, with a dominating [state ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ownership "State ownership") ([Heidrun oil field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidrun_oil_field "Heidrun oil field")).

Export revenues from oil and gas have risen to over 40% of total exports and constitute almost 20% of the GDP.[\[167\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-174) Norway is the fifth-largest oil exporter and third-largest gas exporter in the world, but it is not a member of [OPEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC "OPEC"). In 1995, the Norwegian government established the sovereign wealth fund (["Government Pension Fund – Global"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government_Pension_Fund_of_Norway "The Government Pension Fund of Norway")) to be funded with oil revenues.

The government controls its petroleum resources through a combination of state ownership in major operators in the oil fields (with approximately 62% ownership in Equinor in 2007) and the fully state-owned [Petoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petoro "Petoro"), which has a market value of about twice Equinor, and [SDFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State%27s_Direct_Financial_Interest "State's Direct Financial Interest"). Finally, the government controls licensing of exploration and production of fields. The fund invests in developed financial markets outside Norway. Spending from the fund is constrained by the budgetary rule (_Handlingsregelen_), which limits spending over time to no more than the real value yield of the fund, lowered in 2017 to 3% of the fund's total value.[\[168\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-175)

Between 1966 and 2013, Norwegian companies drilled 5,085 oil wells, mostly in the [North Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea "North Sea").[\[169\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-NorwegianSectorOnly?4053wells-176) Oil fields not yet in the production phase include: [Wisting Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wisting_Central&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wisting Central (page does not exist)")—calculated size in 2013 at 65–156 million barrels of oil and 10 to 40 billion cubic feet (0.28 to 1.13 billion cubic metres), (_utvinnbar_) of gas.[\[170\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-WistingCentral-177) and the [Castberg Oil Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Castberg_Oil_Field&action=edit&redlink=1 "Castberg Oil Field (page does not exist)") (_Castberg-feltet_[\[170\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-WistingCentral-177))—calculated size at 540 million barrels of oil, and 2 to 7 billion cubic feet (57 to 198 million cubic metres) (_utvinnbar_) of gas.[\[171\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Castberg-feltet-178) Both oil fields are located in the [Barents Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barents_Sea "Barents Sea").

Norway is also the world's second-largest exporter of fish (in value, after China).[\[172\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-GGT-179)[\[173\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-180) Fish from fish farms and catch constitutes the second largest (behind oil/natural gas) export product measured in value.[\[174\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-181)[\[175\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-182) Norway is the world's largest producer of salmon, followed by [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile").[\[176\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-183)

[Hydroelectric plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity "Hydroelectricity") generate roughly 98–99% of Norway's electric power, more than any other country in the world.[\[177\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-184)

Norway contains significant mineral resources, and in 2013, its mineral production was valued at US$1.5 billion (Norwegian Geological Survey data). The most valuable minerals are calcium carbonate ([limestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone "Limestone")), building stone, [nepheline syenite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepheline_syenite "Nepheline syenite"), [olivine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine "Olivine"), iron, [titanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium "Titanium"), and [nickel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel "Nickel").[\[178\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-185)

In 2017, the Government Pension Fund controlled assets surpassed a value of US$1 trillion (equal to US$190,000 per capita),[\[179\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-186) about 250% of Norway's 2017 GDP.[\[180\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-187) It is the largest [sovereign wealth fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_wealth_fund "Sovereign wealth fund") in the world.[\[181\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-188)

Other nations with economies based on natural resources, such as Russia, are trying to learn from Norway by establishing similar funds. The investment choices of the Norwegian fund are directed by [ethical guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socially_responsible_investing "Socially responsible investing"); for example, the fund is not allowed to invest in companies that produce parts for nuclear weapons. Norway's highly [transparent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(market) "Transparency (market)") investment scheme[\[182\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-189) is lauded by the international community.[\[183\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-190)

### Transport

Due to the low population density, narrow shape and long coastlines of Norway, its public transport is less developed than in many European countries, especially outside the major cities. The country has long-standing water transport traditions, but the [Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Ministry_of_Transport_and_Communications "Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications") has in recent years implemented rail, road, and air transport through numerous subsidiaries to develop the country's infrastructure.[\[184\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-191) Under discussion is development of a new high-speed rail system between the nation's largest cities.[\[185\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-192)[\[186\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-193)

Norway's main railway network consists of 4,114 kilometres (2,556 mi) of [standard gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gauge "Standard gauge") lines, of which 242 kilometres (150 mi) is [double track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_track "Double track") and 64 kilometres (40 mi) [high-speed rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail "High-speed rail") (210 km/h) while 62% is electrified at [15 kV 16.7 Hz AC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_kV_AC_railway_electrification "15 kV AC railway electrification"). The railways transported 56,827,000 passengers, 2,956 million [passenger-kilometres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_transportation_measurement "Units of transportation measurement"), and 24,783,000 tonnes of cargo for 3,414 million [tonne-kilometres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_transportation_measurement "Units of transportation measurement").[\[187\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-ReferenceB-194) The entire network is owned by [Bane NOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bane_NOR "Bane NOR").[\[188\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-195) Domestic passenger trains are operated by various companies, including [Vy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vy "Vy"), [SJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SJ_AB#SJ_Norge "SJ AB"), [Go-Ahead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-Ahead_Nordic "Go-Ahead Nordic") and [Flytoget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flytoget "Flytoget"), while freight trains are operated by [CargoNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CargoNet "CargoNet") and [OnRail](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OnRail&action=edit&redlink=1 "OnRail (page does not exist)").[\[189\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-196)

Investment in new infrastructure and maintenance is financed through the state budget,[\[190\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-jbvabout-197) and subsidies are provided for passenger train operations.[\[191\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-minpt-198) NSB operates long-haul trains, including [night trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSB_Night_Train "NSB Night Train"), regional services and four [commuter train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuter_rail "Commuter rail") systems, around [Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Commuter_Rail "Oslo Commuter Rail"), [Trondheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%B8ndelag_Commuter_Rail "Trøndelag Commuter Rail"), [Bergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bergen_Commuter_Rail&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bergen Commuter Rail (page does not exist)") and [Stavanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A6ren_Line "Jæren Line").[\[192\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-199)

[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Airport,_Gardermoen "Oslo Airport, Gardermoen")

Norway has approximately 92,946 kilometres (57,754 mi) of road network, of which 72,033 kilometres (44,759 mi) are paved and 664 kilometres (413 mi) are motorway.[\[93\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-factbook-100) The four tiers of road routes are national, county, municipal and private, with national and primary county roads numbered en route. The most important national routes are part of the [European route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_E-road_network "International E-road network") scheme. The two most prominent are the [European route E6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E6 "European route E6") going north–south through the entire country, and the [E39](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E39 "European route E39"), which follows the West Coast. National and county roads are managed by the [Norwegian Public Roads Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Public_Roads_Administration "Norwegian Public Roads Administration").[\[193\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-200)

Norway has the world's largest registered stock of [plug-in electric vehicles per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicles_in_Norway "Plug-in electric vehicles in Norway").[\[194\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-NorwayLargest-201)[\[195\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-AVERE-202)[\[196\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-NorwaySales2011-203) In March 2014, Norway became the first country where over 1 in every 100 passenger cars on the roads is a plug-in electric.[\[197\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-NorwayEVSales032014-204) The plug-in electric segment [market share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share "Market share") of new car sales is also the highest in the world.[\[198\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Top6Global2013-205) According to a report by _[Dagens Næringsliv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagens_N%C3%A6ringsliv "Dagens Næringsliv")_ in June 2016, the country would like to ban sales of gasoline and diesel powered vehicles as early as 2025.[\[199\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-206)

Of the 98 airports in Norway,[\[93\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-factbook-100) 52 are public,[\[200\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-avinorpassengers-207) and 46 are operated by the state-owned [Avinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avinor "Avinor").[\[201\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-208) [Seven airports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_airports_in_the_Nordic_countries "List of the largest airports in the Nordic countries") have more than one million passengers annually.[\[200\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-avinorpassengers-207) A total of 41,089,675 passengers passed through Norwegian airports in 2007, of whom 13,397,458 were international.[\[200\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-avinorpassengers-207)

The central gateway to Norway by air is [Oslo Airport, Gardermoen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Airport,_Gardermoen "Oslo Airport, Gardermoen").[\[200\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-avinorpassengers-207) Located about 35 kilometres (22 mi) northeast of Oslo, it is [hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_hub "Airline hub") for the two major Norwegian airlines: [Scandinavian Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Airlines "Scandinavian Airlines")[\[202\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-209) and [Norwegian Air Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Air_Shuttle "Norwegian Air Shuttle"),[\[203\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-210) and for regional aircraft from Western Norway.[\[204\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-wideroemap-211) There are departures to most European countries and some intercontinental destinations.[\[205\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-212)[\[206\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-213) A direct high-speed train connects to Oslo Central Station every 10 minutes for a 20 min ride.

### Research

[![Image 237](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Niels_Henrik_Abel.jpg/170px-Niels_Henrik_Abel.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Niels_Henrik_Abel.jpg)

[Niels Henrik Abel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel "Niels Henrik Abel") made pioneering contributions in a variety of fields. The [Abel Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Prize "Abel Prize") in mathematics, originally proposed in 1899 to complement the [Nobel Prizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize "Nobel Prize"), is named in his honour.

Norway has a rich history of contributions to science, mathematics, and technology, with several internationally recognized scientists and innovators.

In mathematics, [Niels Henrik Abel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel "Niels Henrik Abel") and [Sophus Lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophus_Lie "Sophus Lie") made groundbreaking contributions to analysis and [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory"). [Caspar Wessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Wessel "Caspar Wessel") was the first to describe [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") and [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") in the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane"), laying the foundation for modern vector and complex analysis. [Thoralf Skolem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoralf_Skolem "Thoralf Skolem") made revolutionary contributions to [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"), while [Øystein Ore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98ystein_Ore "Øystein Ore") and [Ludwig Sylow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_Sylow "Ludvig Sylow") advanced group theory. [Atle Selberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atle_Selberg "Atle Selberg"), a major figure in 20th-century mathematics, was honored with the [Fields Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal "Fields Medal"), [Wolf Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Prize_in_Mathematics "Wolf Prize in Mathematics"), and [Abel Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Prize "Abel Prize"). [Ernst S. Selmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Sejersted_Selmer "Ernst Sejersted Selmer")'s work significantly influenced modern [cryptographic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_algorithm "Cryptographic algorithm").

In physics, notable figures include [Kristian Birkeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristian_Birkeland "Kristian Birkeland"), known for his work on the [aurora borealis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora "Aurora"), and [Ivar Giaever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivar_Giaever "Ivar Giaever"), a Nobel laureate in physics. [Carl Anton Bjerknes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Anton_Bjerknes "Carl Anton Bjerknes") and [Christopher Hansteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hansteen "Christopher Hansteen") made contributions to [hydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodynamics "Hydrodynamics") and [geomagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field"), respectively. The meteorologists [Vilhelm Bjerknes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilhelm_Bjerknes "Vilhelm Bjerknes") and [Ragnar Fjørtoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar_Fj%C3%B8rtoft "Ragnar Fjørtoft") were instrumental in the development of [numerical weather prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction "Numerical weather prediction").

Norwegian chemists like [Lars Onsager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Onsager "Lars Onsager"), a Nobel laureate, and [Odd Hassel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Hassel "Odd Hassel"), recognized for his work in [stereochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereochemistry "Stereochemistry"), have left a lasting legacy.

As of 2024, Norway is ranked 21st in the [Global Innovation Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Innovation_Index "Global Innovation Index") in 2024.[\[207\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-214) The country has produced fourteen Nobel laureates across various disciplines.

### Tourism

In 2008, Norway ranked 17th in the [World Economic Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum "World Economic Forum")'s [Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_and_Tourism_Competitiveness_Report "Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report").[\[208\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-wef1-215) Tourism in Norway contributed to 4.2% of the gross domestic product as reported in 2016.[\[209\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-auto-216) Every one in fifteen people throughout the country work in the tourism industry.[\[209\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-auto-216) Tourism is seasonal in Norway, with more than half of total tourists visiting between the months of May and August.[\[209\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-auto-216)

[![Image 238](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/T%C3%B8nsberg_-_tower_and_ruins.JPG/220px-T%C3%B8nsberg_-_tower_and_ruins.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:T%C3%B8nsberg_-_tower_and_ruins.JPG)

The ruin park of [Tønsberg Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%B8nsberg_Fortress "Tønsberg Fortress") in [Tønsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%B8nsberg "Tønsberg"). The tower in the background was built in 1888 during the city's 1000th anniversary. The ruin park and the tower are today popular tourist attractions.

The main attractions of Norway are the varied landscapes that extend across the [Arctic Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle "Arctic Circle"). It is famous for its coastline and its mountains, ski resorts, lakes and woods. Popular tourist destinations in Norway include [Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo "Oslo"), [Ålesund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85lesund_(town) "Ålesund (town)"), [Bergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen_(city) "Bergen (city)"), [Stavanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavanger_(city) "Stavanger (city)"), [Trondheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim_(city) "Trondheim (city)"), [Kristiansand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristiansand_(town) "Kristiansand (town)"), [Arendal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arendal_(town) "Arendal (town)"), [Tromsø](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troms%C3%B8_(city) "Tromsø (city)"), [Fredrikstad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredrikstad_(town) "Fredrikstad (town)"), and [Tønsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%B8nsberg "Tønsberg"). Much of the nature of Norway remains unspoiled, and thus attracts numerous hikers and skiers. The fjords, mountains and waterfalls in [Western Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Norway "Western Norway") and [Northern Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Norway "Northern Norway") attract several hundred thousand foreign tourists each year. In the cities, cultural idiosyncrasies such as the [Holmenkollen ski jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmenkollen_ski_jump "Holmenkollen ski jump") in Oslo and [Saga Oseberg](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%ABSaga_Oseberg%C2%BB "no:«Saga Oseberg»") in Tønsberg attract many visitors, as do landmarks such as [Bryggen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryggen "Bryggen") in Bergen, [Vigeland installation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigeland_installation "Vigeland installation") in [Frogner Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogner_Park "Frogner Park") in Oslo, [Nidaros Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidaros_Cathedral "Nidaros Cathedral") in Trondheim, [Fredrikstad Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredrikstad_Fortress "Fredrikstad Fortress") (_Gamlebyen_) in Fredrikstad, and [the ruin park of Tønsberg Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%B8nsberg_Fortress "Tønsberg Fortress") in Tønsberg.

Demographics

### Population

[![Image 239](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Annual_population_growth_of_Norway.svg/260px-Annual_population_growth_of_Norway.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Annual_population_growth_of_Norway.svg)

Annual [population growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth "Population growth") in Norway 1951–2016, in thousands

Norway's population was 5,384,576 people in the third quarter of 2020.[\[210\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-217) [Norwegians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegians "Norwegians") are an ethnic North [Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples "Germanic peoples") people. The [total fertility rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate "Total fertility rate") (TFR) in 2018 was estimated at 1.56 children born per woman,[\[211\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-218) below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 4.69 children born per woman in 1877.[\[212\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-219) In 2018 the [median age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_age "Median age") of the Norwegian population was 39.3 years.

The [Sámi people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_people "Sámi people") are indigenous to the Far North and have traditionally inhabited central and northern parts of Norway and Sweden, as well as areas in northern Finland and in Russia on the [Kola Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Peninsula "Kola Peninsula"). Another national minority are the [Kven people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kven_people "Kven people"), descendants of Finnish-speaking people who migrated to northern Norway from the 18th up to the 20th century. From the 19th century up to the 1970s, the Norwegian government tried to assimilate both the Sámi and the Kven, encouraging them to adopt the majority language, culture and religion.[\[213\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-220) Because of this "[Norwegianization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegianization "Norwegianization") process", many families of Sámi or Kven ancestry now identify as ethnic Norwegian.[\[214\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-221)

The national minorities of Norway are Kvens, [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews"), [Forest Finns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Finns "Forest Finns"), and [Romani people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people "Romani people").[\[215\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-222)

In 2017, the population of Norway ranked first on the [World Happiness Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report "World Happiness Report").[\[216\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Rankin_2017-223)

### Migration

[![Image 240](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Percentage_of_Norwegians_born_to_two_Norwegian_parents.png/260px-Percentage_of_Norwegians_born_to_two_Norwegian_parents.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Percentage_of_Norwegians_born_to_two_Norwegian_parents.png)

Norwegians of two Norwegian parents, either born abroad or in Norway as a percentage proportionally and nationally in Norway as of 2021

Particularly in the 19th century, when economic conditions were difficult in Norway, tens of thousands of people migrated to the United States and Canada, where they could work and buy land in frontier areas. Many went to the Midwest and Pacific Northwest. In 2006, according to the US Census Bureau, almost 4.7 million persons identified as [Norwegian Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Americans "Norwegian Americans"),[\[217\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-224) which was larger than the population of ethnic Norwegians in Norway itself.[\[218\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Pop16-225) In the 2011 Canadian census, 452,705 Canadian citizens identified as having [Norwegian ancestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Canadians "Norwegian Canadians").[\[219\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Norwegian_Canadians-226)

In 2024, approximately 931,081 individuals (16.8% of the population) of the population of Norway were immigrants. Of these, 386,559 (41.5%) had a [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture") background (Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand), while 544,521 (58.5%) had a non-Western background (Asia, Africa, South and Central America). 221,459 individuals (4% of the population) were children of immigrants, born in Norway.[\[220\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-:0-227)

The largest groups of immigrants have come from [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland"), [Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania "Lithuania"), [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden") and [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria"), as well as [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine") since the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine") in 2022.[\[220\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-:0-227)

Immigrants have settled in all Norwegian municipalities. In 2013, the cities with the highest share of immigrants were [Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo "Oslo") (32%) and [Drammen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drammen_(town) "Drammen (town)") (27%).[\[221\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-innvbef-228) According to [Reuters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters "Reuters"), Oslo is the "fastest growing city in Europe because of increased immigration".[\[222\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-229) In recent years, immigration has accounted for most of Norway's population growth.[\[223\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-230)

### Religion

#### Church of Norway

[![Image 241](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Nidaros_Cathedral%2C_Trondheim%2C_West_view_20150605_1.jpg/220px-Nidaros_Cathedral%2C_Trondheim%2C_West_view_20150605_1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nidaros_Cathedral,_Trondheim,_West_view_20150605_1.jpg)

[Nidaros Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidaros_Cathedral "Nidaros Cathedral") in [Trondheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim "Trondheim")

[Separation of church and state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state#Norway "Separation of church and state") happened significantly later in Norway than in most of Europe, and remains incomplete. In 2012, the Norwegian parliament voted to grant the [Church of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Norway "Church of Norway") greater autonomy,[\[224\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-231) a decision which was confirmed in a constitutional amendment on 21 May 2012.[\[225\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-232)

Until 2012 parliamentary officials were required to be members of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Norway, and at least half of all government ministers had to be a member of the state church. As state church, the Church of Norway's clergy were viewed as state employees, and the central and regional church administrations were part of the state administration. Members of the Royal family are required to be members of the Lutheran church. On 1 January 2017, Norway made the church independent of the state, but retained the Church's status as the "people's church".[\[226\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-233)[\[227\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-234)

Most Norwegians are registered at baptism as members of the Church of Norway. Many remain in the church to participate in the community and practices such as [baptism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism "Baptism"), [confirmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation "Confirmation"), marriage, and burial rites. About 70.6% of Norwegians were members of the Church of Norway in 2017. In 2017, about 53.6% of all newborns were baptised and about 57.9% of all 15-year-olds were [confirmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_(Lutheran_Church) "Confirmation (Lutheran Church)") in the church.[\[228\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-235)

#### Religious affiliation

Official religious affiliation in Norway (31 December 2019):[\[229\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-stat2019statechurch-236)[\[230\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-stat2019other-237)[\[231\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-238)

Other Christian denominations (2.21%)

According to the 2010 Eurobarometer Poll, 22% of Norwegian citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", 44% responded that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 29% responded that "they don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force". Five per cent gave no response.[\[232\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-eurobarometer_2010-239) In the early 1990s, studies estimated that between 4.7% and 5.3% of Norwegians attended church on a weekly basis.[\[233\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-240) This figure has dropped to about 2%.[\[234\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-241)[\[235\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-242)

In 2010, 10% of the population was [religiously unaffiliated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion "Irreligion"), while another 9% were members of religious communities outside the Church of Norway.[\[236\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Norway1-243) Other Christian denominations total about 4.9%[\[236\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Norway1-243) of the population, the largest of which is the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church"), with 83,000 members, according to 2009 government statistics.[\[237\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Norwayreligion2-244) The _Aftenposten_ (Evening Post) in October 2012 reported there were about 115,234 registered Roman Catholics in Norway; the reporter estimated that the total number of people with a Roman Catholic background may be 170,000–200,000 or higher.[\[238\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-245)

The Swedish, Finnish and Icelandic Lutheran congregations in Norway have about 27,500 members in total.[\[237\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Norwayreligion2-244) Other Christian denominations comprise less than 1% each, including 4,000 members in [the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints") and 12,000 [Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses "Jehovah's Witnesses").[\[237\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Norwayreligion2-244) Among non-Christian religions, [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Norway "Islam in Norway") is the largest, with 166,861 registered members (2018), and probably fewer than 200,000 in total.[\[239\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-autogenerated5-246)

Other religions comprise less than 1% each, including 819 adherents of [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Norway "History of the Jews in Norway").[\[240\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Norwayreligion-247) Indian immigrants introduced Hinduism to Norway, which in 2011 has slightly more than 5,900 adherents, or 1% of non-Lutheran Norwegians.[\[240\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Norwayreligion-247) [Sikhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism "Sikhism") has approximately 3,000 adherents, with most living in Oslo, which has two [gurdwaras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara "Gurdwara"). Drammen also has a sizeable population of Sikhs; the largest gurdwara in north Europe was built in [Lier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lier,_Norway "Lier, Norway"). There are eleven Buddhist organisations, grouped under the [Buddhistforbundet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_Federation_of_Norway "Buddhist Federation of Norway") organisation, with slightly over 14,000 members,[\[240\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Norwayreligion-247) which make up 0.2% of the population. The [Baháʼí Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith "Baháʼí Faith") religion has slightly more than 1,000 adherents.[\[240\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Norwayreligion-247) Around 1.7% (84,500) of Norwegians belong to the secular [Norwegian Humanist Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Humanist_Association "Norwegian Humanist Association").

From 2006 to 2011, the fastest-growing religious communities in Norway were [Eastern Orthodox Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodoxy_in_Norway "Eastern Orthodoxy in Norway") and [Oriental Orthodox Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Orthodoxy_in_Norway "Oriental Orthodoxy in Norway"), which grew in membership by 80%; however, their share of the total population remains small, at 0.2%. It is associated with the immigration from Eritrea and Ethiopia, and to a lesser extent from [Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe "Central Europe") and Eastern European and Middle Eastern countries. Other fast-growing religions were [Roman Catholicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Norway "Roman Catholicism in Norway") (78.7%), [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_Norway "Hinduism in Norway") (59.6%), [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Norway "Islam in Norway") (48.1%), and [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Norway "Buddhism in Norway") (46.7%).[\[241\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-248)

#### Indigenous religions

As in other Scandinavian countries, the ancient Norse followed a form of [Germanic paganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_paganism "Germanic paganism") known as [Norse paganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_paganism "Norse paganism"). By the end of the 11th century, when Norway had been [Christianised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization_of_Scandinavia "Christianization of Scandinavia"), the indigenous Norse religion and practices were prohibited. Remnants of the native religion and beliefs of Norway survive today in the form of names, referential names of cities and locations, the days of the week, and everyday language. Modern interest in the old ways has led to a revival of pagan religious practices in the form of _[Åsatru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_Neopaganism "Germanic Neopaganism")._ The Norwegian _[Åsatrufellesskapet Bifrost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85satrufellesskapet_Bifrost "Åsatrufellesskapet Bifrost")_ formed in 1996; in 2011, the fellowship had about 300 members. _Foreningen Forn Sed_ was formed in 1999 and has been recognised by the Norwegian government.

The Sámi minority retained their [shamanistic religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_shamanism "Sámi shamanism") well into the 18th century, when most converted to Christianity under the influence of Dano-Norwegian Lutheran [missionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries "Missionaries"). Today there is a renewed appreciation for the Sámi traditional way of life, which has led to a revival of _[Noaidevuohta](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Noaidevuohta&action=edit&redlink=1 "Noaidevuohta (page does not exist)")_.[\[242\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-249) Some Norwegian and Sámi celebrities are reported to visit [shamans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamans "Shamans") for guidance.[\[243\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-250)[\[244\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-251)

### Health

[![Image 242](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Life_expectancy_in_Norway.svg/220px-Life_expectancy_in_Norway.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Life_expectancy_in_Norway.svg)

Development of life expectancy in Norway

Norway was awarded first place according to the UN's [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index "Human Development Index") (HDI) for 2013.[\[245\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-252) From the 1900s, improvements in public health occurred as a result of development in several areas such as social and [living conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_condition "Living condition"), changes in disease and medical outbreaks, establishment of the health care system, and emphasis on public health matters. [Vaccination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination "Vaccination") and increased treatment opportunities with antibiotics resulted in great improvements within the Norwegian population. Improved hygiene and better nutrition were factors that contributed to improved health.

The disease pattern in Norway changed from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases and chronic diseases as [cardiovascular disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease "Cardiovascular disease"). Inequalities and social differences are still present in public health in Norway.[\[246\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Folkehelse_i_Norge_1814_%E2%80%93_2014-253)

In 2013 the infant mortality rate was 2.5 per 1,000 live births among children under the age of one. For girls it was 2.7 and for boys 2.3, which is the lowest infant mortality rate for boys ever recorded in Norway.[\[247\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-254)

### Education

[![Image 243](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/NTNU.jpg/220px-NTNU.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NTNU.jpg)

The main building of the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_University_of_Science_and_Technology "Norwegian University of Science and Technology") in [Trondheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim_(city) "Trondheim (city)")

[Higher education in Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_Norway "Higher education in Norway") is offered by a range of seven [universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Norway "List of universities in Norway"), five specialised colleges, 25 [university colleges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_college "University college") as well as a range of private colleges. Education follows the [Bologna Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_Process "Bologna Process") involving [Bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree "Bachelor's degree") (3 years), [Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree "Master's degree") (2 years) and PhD (3 years) degrees.[\[248\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-255) Acceptance is offered after finishing [upper secondary school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Norway "Education in Norway") with general study competence.

Public education is virtually free for citizens from EU/EEA and Switzerland, but other nationalities need to pay tuition fees.[\[249\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-256)[\[250\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-257)[\[251\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-258) Higher education has historically been free for everyone regardless of nationality, but tuition fees for all students from outside EU/EEA and Switzerland was implemented in 2023.[\[252\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-259)[\[253\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-260)

The academic year has two [semesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_term "Academic term"), from August to December and from January to June. The ultimate responsibility for the education lies with the [Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Ministry_of_Education_and_Research "Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research").

### Languages

[![Image 244](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Norske_M%C3%A5lgreiner.png/220px-Norske_M%C3%A5lgreiner.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Norske_M%C3%A5lgreiner.png)

The map shows the division of the Norwegian dialects within the main groups.

Norwegian in its two forms, [Bokmål](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokm%C3%A5l "Bokmål") and [Nynorsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nynorsk "Nynorsk"), is the main national official language of all of Norway. Sámi, a group which includes three separate languages, is recognised as a minority language on the national level and is a co-official language alongside Norwegian in the Sámi administrative linguistic area (_Forvaltningsområdet for samisk språk_) in Northern Norway.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-LanguageCouncilSami-2) [Kven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kven_language "Kven language") is a minority language and is a co-official language alongside Norwegian in one municipality, also in Northern Norway.[\[254\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-261)[\[255\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-262)[\[256\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-263)

#### Norwegian

Norwegian is a [North Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Germanic_languages "North Germanic languages") language descended from [Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse "Old Norse"). It is the main national language of Norway and is spoken throughout the country. Norwegian is spoken natively by over 5 million people mainly in Norway, but is generally understood throughout [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia") and to a lesser degree other [Nordic countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries "Nordic countries"). It has two official written forms, _[Bokmål](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokm%C3%A5l "Bokmål")_ and _[Nynorsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nynorsk "Nynorsk")_. Both are used in public administration, schools, churches, and media. Bokmål is the written language used by a majority of about 85%. Around 95% of the population speak Norwegian as their first or native language, although many speak dialects that may differ significantly from the written languages. Norwegian dialects are mutually intelligible, although listeners with limited exposure to dialects other than their own may struggle with certain phrases and pronunciations.

Norwegian is closely related to and generally mutually intelligible with its neighbour [Scandinavian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Germanic_languages "North Germanic languages"); [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language "Danish language") and [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language "Swedish language"), and the three main Scandinavian languages thus form both a [dialect continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum "Dialect continuum") and a larger language community with about 25 million speakers. All three languages are commonly employed in communication among inhabitants of the Scandinavian countries. As a result of the co-operation within the [Nordic Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Council "Nordic Council"), inhabitants of all Nordic countries always have the right to communicate with Norwegian authorities in Danish or Swedish as equal alternatives to Norwegian.[\[257\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-264) In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Norwegian language was subject to [strong political and cultural controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language_conflict "Norwegian language conflict"). This led to the development of Nynorsk in the 19th century and to the formation of alternative spelling standards in the 20th century.

#### Sámi and Kven

Several [Uralic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_languages "Uralic languages") Sámi languages, which are related but not generally mutually intelligible, are traditionally spoken by the Sámi people primarily in Northern Norway and to much lesser extent in some parts of Central Norway. Around 15,000 people have officially registered as Sámi in the Sámi census (_Samemanntallet_), but the number of people of recent Sámi heritage is often estimated at 50,000 people. The number of people who have some knowledge of Northern Sámi, including as a second language, is estimated at 25,000 people, but only a minority are native speakers. The other Sámi languages are heavily endangered and spoken by at most a few hundred people. Most people of Sámi heritage are today native speakers of Norwegian as a result of past assimilation policies.[\[258\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-265)

Speakers have a right to be educated and to receive communication from the government in their own language in a special _forvaltningsområde_ (administrative area) for Sámi languages.[\[259\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-266)[\[260\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-267) The [Kven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kven_people "Kven people") minority historically spoke the Uralic [Kven language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kven_language "Kven language") (considered a separate language in Norway, but generally perceived as a Finnish dialect in Finland). Today the majority of ethnic Kven have little or no knowledge of the language.[\[261\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-268) As Norway has ratified the [European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages "European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages") (ECRML) the Kven language together with [Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_language "Romani language") and [Scandoromani language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandoromani_language "Scandoromani language") has become officially recognised minority languages.[\[262\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-269)[\[263\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-270)

#### Other languages

Some supporters have also advocated making [Norwegian Sign Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Sign_Language "Norwegian Sign Language") an official language.[\[264\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-271)[\[265\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-272)

The primary foreign language taught in Norwegian schools is English, and the majority of the population, especially those born after World War II, is fairly fluent in English. German, French and Spanish are also commonly taught as second or, more often, third languages. Russian, Japanese, Italian, [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin"), and rarely [Chinese (Mandarin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Mandarin "Standard Mandarin") are offered in some schools, mostly in the cities. Traditionally, English, German and French were considered the main foreign languages in Norway. These languages, for instance, were used on [Norwegian passports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_passport "Norwegian passport") until the 1990s, and university students have a general right to use these languages when submitting their theses.

90% of Norwegians are fluent in English.[\[266\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-273)

Culture
-------

[![Image 245](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Wilhelmine_Seippel.jpg/220px-Wilhelmine_Seippel.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wilhelmine_Seippel.jpg)

Traditional Norwegian farmer's costumes, known as _folkedrakt_, and modern costumes inspired by those costumes, known as _[bunad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunad "Bunad")_, are widely used on special occasions.

The Norwegian farm culture continues to play a role in contemporary Norwegian culture. In the 19th century, it inspired a strong [romantic nationalistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_romantic_nationalism "Norwegian romantic nationalism") movement, which is still visible in the [Norwegian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language "Norwegian language") and [media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mass_media_in_Norway "Category:Mass media in Norway"). Norwegian culture expanded with nationalist efforts to achieve an independent identity in the areas of literature, art and music. This continues today in the performing arts and as a result of government support for exhibitions, cultural projects and artwork.[\[267\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-274)

### Cinema

Norwegian cinema has received international recognition. The documentary film _[Kon-Tiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kon-Tiki_(1950_film) "Kon-Tiki (1950 film)")_ (1950) won an [Academy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards"). Another notable film is _[The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pinchcliffe_Grand_Prix "The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix")_, an animated feature film directed by [Ivo Caprino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_Caprino "Ivo Caprino"). The film was released in 1975 and is the most widely seen Norwegian film of all time.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] [Nils Gaup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Gaup "Nils Gaup")'s _[Pathfinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder_(1987_film) "Pathfinder (1987 film)")_ (1987), the story of the [Sámi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_people "Sámi people"), was nominated for an Oscar. [Berit Nesheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berit_Nesheim "Berit Nesheim")'s _[The Other Side of Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Side_of_Sunday "The Other Side of Sunday")_ was nominated for an Oscar in 1997.

Oslo used to have a summer parade similar to the German [Love Parade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Parade "Love Parade"). In 1992, the city of Oslo wanted to adopt the French music festival _Fête de la Musique_. [Fredrik Carl Størmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredrik_Carl_St%C3%B8rmer "Fredrik Carl Størmer") established the festival. From its first year, "Musikkens Dag" gathered thousands of people and artists in the streets of Oslo. "Musikkens Dag" is now renamed _Musikkfest Oslo_.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

### Literature

[![Image 248](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Henrik_Ibsen_av_Eilif_Peterssen_1895.jpg/220px-Henrik_Ibsen_av_Eilif_Peterssen_1895.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Henrik_Ibsen_av_Eilif_Peterssen_1895.jpg)

[Henrik Ibsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen "Henrik Ibsen"), the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare").

The history of Norwegian literature starts with the [pagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_paganism "Norse paganism") [Eddaic poems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_Edda "Poetic Edda") and [skaldic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skald "Skald") verse of the ninth and tenth centuries, with poets such as [Bragi Boddason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragi_Boddason "Bragi Boddason") and [Eyvindr skáldaspillir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyvindr_sk%C3%A1ldaspillir "Eyvindr skáldaspillir"). The arrival of Christianity around the year 1000 brought Norway into contact with European medieval learning, [hagiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagiography "Hagiography") and history writing. Merged with native oral tradition and Icelandic influence, this influenced the literature written in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Major works of that period include _[Historia Norwegiæ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Norwegi%C3%A6 "Historia Norwegiæ")_, _[Þiðrekssaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Ei%C3%B0rekssaga "Þiðrekssaga")_ and _[Konungs skuggsjá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konungs_skuggsj%C3%A1 "Konungs skuggsjá")_.

Little Norwegian literature came out of the period of the Scandinavian Union and the subsequent Dano-Norwegian union (1387–1814), with some notable exceptions such as [Petter Dass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petter_Dass "Petter Dass") and [Ludvig Holberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_Holberg "Ludvig Holberg"). During the union with Denmark, the government imposed using only written Danish, which decreased the writing of Norwegian literature.

Two major events precipitated a major resurgence in Norwegian literature: in 1811 a Norwegian university was established in [Christiania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo "Oslo"), and in 1814 the Norwegians created their first [Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Norway "Constitution of Norway"). Authors were inspired and became recognised first in Scandinavia, and then worldwide; among them were [Henrik Wergeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Wergeland "Henrik Wergeland"), [Peter Christen Asbjørnsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Christen_Asbj%C3%B8rnsen "Peter Christen Asbjørnsen"), [Jørgen Moe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B8rgen_Moe "Jørgen Moe") and [Camilla Collett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla_Collett "Camilla Collett").

By the late 19th century, in the [Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age "Golden Age") of Norwegian literature, the so-called "Great Four" emerged: [Henrik Ibsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen "Henrik Ibsen"), [Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rnstjerne_Bj%C3%B8rnson "Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson"), [Alexander Kielland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Kielland "Alexander Kielland"), and [Jonas Lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Lie_(writer) "Jonas Lie (writer)"). Bjørnson's "peasant novels", such as _Ein glad gut_ (A Happy Boy) and _Synnøve Solbakken_, are typical of the [Norwegian romantic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_romantic_nationalism "Norwegian romantic nationalism") of their day. Kielland's novels and short stories are mostly naturalistic. Although an important contributor to early romantic nationalism, (especially _[Peer Gynt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_Gynt "Peer Gynt")_), [Henrik Ibsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen "Henrik Ibsen") is better known for his pioneering realistic dramas such as _[The Wild Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Duck "The Wild Duck")_ and _[A Doll's House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Doll%27s_House "A Doll's House")._

In the 20th century, three Norwegian novelists were awarded the [Nobel Prize in Literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature "Nobel Prize in Literature"): [Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rnstjerne_Bj%C3%B8rnson "Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson") in 1903, [Knut Hamsun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knut_Hamsun "Knut Hamsun") for the book _Markens grøde_ ("[Growth of the Soil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_of_the_Soil "Growth of the Soil")") in 1920, and [Sigrid Undset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigrid_Undset "Sigrid Undset") (known for _[Kristin Lavransdatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin_Lavransdatter "Kristin Lavransdatter")_) in 1928.

### Architecture

[![Image 249](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Urnesstavkirke.jpg/220px-Urnesstavkirke.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Urnesstavkirke.jpg)

The [Urnes Stave Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urnes_Stave_Church "Urnes Stave Church") has been listed by [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") as a [World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site "World Heritage Site").

[![Image 250](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Dalen_Hotell_IMG_4773.jpg/220px-Dalen_Hotell_IMG_4773.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dalen_Hotell_IMG_4773.jpg)

[Dalen Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalen_Hotel "Dalen Hotel") in [Telemark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemark "Telemark") built in [Dragon Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragestil "Dragestil"), a style of design architecture that originated during the [Norwegian romantic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_romantic_nationalism "Norwegian romantic nationalism").

With expansive forests, Norway has long had a tradition of building in wood. Many of today's most interesting new buildings are made of wood, reflecting the strong appeal that this material continues to hold for Norwegian designers and builders.[\[276\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-283)

With Norway's conversion to Christianity, churches were built. Stonework architecture was introduced from Europe for the most important structures, beginning with the construction of [Nidaros Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidaros_Cathedral "Nidaros Cathedral") in [Trondheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim_(city) "Trondheim (city)"). In the early [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"), wooden [stave churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stave_church "Stave church") were constructed throughout Norway. Some of them have survived; they represent Norway's most unusual contribution to architectural history. [Urnes Stave Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urnes_Stave_Church "Urnes Stave Church") in inner [Sognefjord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sognefjord "Sognefjord") is on [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO")'s [World Heritage List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_List "World Heritage List"). Another notable example of wooden architecture is the buildings at [Bryggen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryggen "Bryggen") Wharf in Bergen, also on the list for World Cultural Heritage sites, consisting of a row of tall, narrow wooden structures along the quayside.

In the 17th century, under the Danish monarchy, cities and villages such as [Kongsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongsberg_(town) "Kongsberg (town)") and [Røros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B8ros_(town) "Røros (town)") were established. The city Kongsberg had a church built in the Baroque style. Traditional wooden buildings that were constructed in Røros have survived.

After Norway's union with Denmark was dissolved in 1814, Oslo became the capital. The architect [Christian H. Grosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Heinrich_Grosch "Christian Heinrich Grosch") designed the earliest parts of the [University of Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oslo "University of Oslo"), the [Oslo Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Stock_Exchange "Oslo Stock Exchange"), and many other buildings and churches constructed in that early national period.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the city of [Ålesund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85lesund_(town) "Ålesund (town)") was rebuilt in the [Art Nouveau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau "Art Nouveau") style, influenced by styles of France. The 1930s, when functionalism dominated, became a strong period for Norwegian architecture. It is only since the late 20th century that Norwegian architects have achieved international renown. One of the most striking modern buildings in Norway is the [Sámi Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_Parliament_of_Norway "Sámi Parliament of Norway") in [Kárášjohka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karasjok_(village) "Karasjok (village)"), designed by [Stein Halvorson](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stein_Halvorson&action=edit&redlink=1 "Stein Halvorson (page does not exist)") and [Christian Sundby](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christian_Sundby&action=edit&redlink=1 "Christian Sundby (page does not exist)"). Its debating chamber, in timber, is an abstract version of a _[lavvo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavvu "Lavvu"),_ the traditional tent used by the nomadic [Sámi people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_people "Sámi people").[\[277\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-284)

### Art

[![Image 251](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/The_Scream.jpg/220px-The_Scream.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Scream.jpg)

[The Scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream "The Scream") by [Edvard Munch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Munch "Edvard Munch"), 1893

For an extended period, the Norwegian art scene was dominated by artwork from Germany and Holland as well as by the influence of Copenhagen. It was in the 19th century that a truly Norwegian era began, first with portraits, later with impressive landscapes. [Johan Christian Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Christian_Dahl "Johan Christian Dahl"), originally from the Dresden school, eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time."[\[278\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-HFG-285)

Norway's newly found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as [Kitty Kielland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitty_Lange_Kielland "Kitty Lange Kielland"), a female painter who studied under [Hans Gude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Gude "Hans Gude"), and [Harriet Backer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Backer "Harriet Backer"), another pioneer among female artists, influenced by [impressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism "Impressionism"). [Frits Thaulow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frits_Thaulow "Frits Thaulow"), an impressionist, was influenced by the art scene in Paris as was [Christian Krohg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Krohg "Christian Krohg"), a realist painter, famous for his paintings of prostitutes.[\[279\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-286)

Of particular note is [Edvard Munch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Munch "Edvard Munch"), a symbolist/expressionist painter who became world-famous for _[The Scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream "The Scream")_ which is said to represent the anxiety of modern man. Other notable works from Munch includes [The Sick Child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sick_Child_(Munch) "The Sick Child (Munch)"), [Madonna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(Munch) "Madonna (Munch)") and [Puberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty_(Munch) "Puberty (Munch)").

Other artists of note include [Harald Sohlberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Sohlberg "Harald Sohlberg"), a neo-romantic painter remembered for his paintings of [Røros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B8ros_(town) "Røros (town)"), and [Odd Nerdrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Nerdrum "Odd Nerdrum"), a figurative painter who maintains that his work is not art, but [kitsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch "Kitsch").

### Cuisine

Norway's culinary traditions show the influence of long seafaring and farming traditions, with [salmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon "Salmon") (fresh and cured), [herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herring "Herring") (pickled or marinated), [trout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trout "Trout"), [codfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod "Cod"), and other seafood, balanced by cheeses (such as [brunost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunost "Brunost"), [Jarlsberg cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarlsberg_cheese "Jarlsberg cheese"), and [gamalost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamalost "Gamalost")), dairy products, and breads (predominantly dark/darker).

[Lefse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefse "Lefse") is a Norwegian potato flatbread, usually topped with large amounts of butter and sugar, most commonly eaten around Christmas. Traditional Norwegian dishes include [lutefisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutefisk "Lutefisk"), [smalahove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalahove "Smalahove"), [pinnekjøtt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinnekj%C3%B8tt "Pinnekjøtt"), [raspeball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspeball "Raspeball"), and [fårikål](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A5rik%C3%A5l "Fårikål").[\[280\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-287) A Norwegian speciality is rakefisk, which is fermented trout, consumed with thin flatbread and sour cream. The most popular pastry is vaffel.

Sports are a central part of Norwegian culture, and popular sports include [cross-country skiing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-country_skiing_(sport) "Cross-country skiing (sport)"), [ski jumping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_jumping "Ski jumping"), [mountaineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaineering "Mountaineering"), [hiking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking "Hiking"), association football, [handball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball "Handball"), [biathlon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon "Biathlon"), [speed skating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_track_speed_skating "Long track speed skating"), and, to a lesser degree, [ice hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey "Ice hockey").

Norway is known internationally for its role in the development of modern winter sports, particularly skiing. From the 19th century Norway also became a premier [mountaineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaineering "Mountaineering") destination, with books such as [William Cecil Slingsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cecil_Slingsby "William Cecil Slingsby")'s _[Norway, the Northern Playground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway,_the_Northern_Playground "Norway, the Northern Playground")_ contributing to the country's popularity among early mountain climbers.[\[281\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-288)

Association football is the most popular sport in Norway in terms of active membership. In 2014–2015 polling, football ranked far behind [biathlon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon "Biathlon") and [cross-country skiing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-country_skiing_(sport) "Cross-country skiing (sport)") in terms of popularity as spectator sports.[\[282\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-Spopop-289) [Ice hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey "Ice hockey") is the biggest indoor sport.[\[283\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#cite_note-NorHall-290) The [women's handball national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway_women%27s_national_handball_team "Norway women's national handball team") has won several titles, including two [Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympics "Summer Olympics") championships ([2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics "Handball at the 2008 Summer Olympics"), [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics "Handball at the 2012 Summer Olympics")), three [World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Women%27s_Handball_Championship "World Women's Handball Championship") ([1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_World_Women%27s_Handball_Championship "1999 World Women's Handball Championship"), [2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_World_Women%27s_Handball_Championship "2011 World Women's Handball Championship"), [2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_World_Women%27s_Handball_Championship "2015 World Women's Handball Championship")), and six [European Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Women%27s_Handball_Championship "European Women's Handball Championship") ([1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_European_Women%27s_Handball_Championship "1998 European Women's Handball Championship"), [2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_European_Women%27s_Handball_Championship "2004 European Women's Handball Championship"), [2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_European_Women%27s_Handball_Championship "2006 European Women's Handball Championship"), [2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_European_Women%27s_Handball_Championship "2008 European Women's Handball Championship"), [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_European_Women%27s_Handball_Championship "2010 European Women's Handball Championship"), [2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_European_Women%27s_Handball_Championship "2014 European Women's Handball Championship")).
